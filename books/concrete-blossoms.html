        <div class='book-intro'>Xia Wu has lived in four cities across six decades, and this book is what that living looks like when compressed to its barest elements: a sparrow landing, coal smoke rising, a weed finding the crack in the pavement that the city forgot to seal. &#x27;Concrete Blossoms&#x27; is not a memoir, but it holds a life. The haiku gathered here were written across many years and many time zones, in kitchens and on canal banks, in the early mornings of cities that did not yet know the poet&#x27;s name. What connects them is not narrative but attention — a refusal to look away from the small, insistent negotiations between the built world and the living one.

Haiku, for Wu, is not a form of reduction but of pressure. These poems do not summarize experience; they locate the exact moment when experience becomes undeniable. A persimmon hanging after the branch has shed its leaves. Ice on elevated train tracks making a sound like something slowly tearing. An unlabelled jar opened in a kitchen that could be anywhere, and the stillness that follows. The cities change — Beijing, somewhere subtropical, somewhere European, Chicago — but the eye remains the same: patient, precise, and quietly astonished that the world keeps offering itself up like this.

The book moves roughly chronologically, though time in haiku is always a little elastic. Readers who follow the sections in order will trace a life in motion — childhood, migration, labor, solitude, arrival, and finally a kind of hard-won ease with not knowing exactly where you are. Readers who open to any page will find what haiku has always offered: a single moment, fully inhabited, asking nothing except that you stay inside it for a breath.</div>
