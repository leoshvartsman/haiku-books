        <div class='book-intro'>These poems were written in the margins of a life that refused to stay in one place. Quinn Novak has lived in Hanoi, Baltimore, Casablanca, and Kathmandu, among other cities that do not appear here by name but whose light is everywhere in these lines — the particular angle of an afternoon, the specific weight of a season&#x27;s humidity, the way a body learns to move through heat or altitude or grief and then cannot unlearn it. Salt in Every Soil is not a travel book. It is not, strictly speaking, a memoir. It is an account of what the body insists on keeping after the mind has done its reasonable work of letting go.

Haiku has always been a form interested in the instant — the hinge between perception and meaning, the moment before interpretation closes over experience like water over a stone. Novak uses that hinge with precision and without sentimentality. These poems do not explain their wounds. They do not resolve their displacements into lesson or consolation. What they do is remain present to the texture of a life lived across latitudes and languages, where the word for home exists in four tongues and fits comfortably in none of them. The collection moves — roughly, not rigidly — from inherited grief toward something that might be called stillness, though Novak is careful never to let that stillness be mistaken for peace. Peace would be easier. This is harder and more honest.

The seven sections trace an arc that is less chronological than geological: layers of place and wound and labor and language, compressed until they yield something durable. Readers who have lived between cultures, between languages, between the person they were given and the person they are becoming, will find this terrain familiar. But the poems do not require that biography. They require only attention — the same quality they themselves practice, line by line, in the difficult and ordinary work of staying present to a world that is always, in every soil, a little salt.</div>
