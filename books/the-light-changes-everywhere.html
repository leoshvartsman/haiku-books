        <div class='book-intro'>These poems were not planned. They arrived the way most true things do — sideways, in the margins, during the minutes before a deposition began or after a trail disappeared into fog. Dakota Young spent years as a lawyer learning to read language for what it concealed, for the load-bearing clause buried in the subordinate clause, for the word chosen precisely because it gave nothing away. The haiku in this collection are the opposite of that training and, in some ways, its completion: small structures that hold open rather than close down, that ask the reader to stand still long enough for the world to move.</div>

        <div class='sample-haiku'><h2>Sample Haiku</h2><div class="haiku"><p>purple on black tar:</p><p>I used to press them flat once,</p><p>thought I&#x27;d keep them all</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>I read the contract</p><p>through — then read it through again —</p><p>rain on the window</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>damp workshop, eight chairs</p><p>the others write without looking up —</p><p>I begin again</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>the margin runs out</p><p>I fold the corner of the page —</p><p>a room with no door</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>the temple is small—</p><p>the tower above it has</p><p>forty-seven floors</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>cloud forest, midweek —</p><p>the markers keep their red on</p><p>even in the grey</p></div>
