        <div class='book-intro'>There is a kind of life that cannot be measured in years or milestones but only in the quality of light — the way it falls on white stone, on grey water, on a wet harbour deck at dusk. Alex Andersson has lived such a life, moving across latitudes that might as well be different planets: the scorched luminosity of Athens, the slate-cold discipline of the Scottish Highlands, the vertiginous neon of Hong Kong. Stone, Water, Smoke is the record of that movement, written in the form that most honestly mirrors how memory and perception actually work — not in paragraphs but in flashes, not in argument but in image, in the sudden arrest of attention that tells us something true is happening.

Haiku, as a form, has always understood that the self is not the subject. The crow, the frost, the smell of peat at first light — these are not backdrops to human feeling; they are its measure and its correction. Andersson works in this tradition while pressing against it, allowing the biographical to surface just enough to give the ecological its weight, and the ecological just enough authority to keep the personal honest. What emerges across two hundred and fifty poems is less a memoir than a cartography: a map not of places visited but of what those places did to a single, quietly attentive consciousness over the course of a life.

Readers may move through these seven sections in order, following the rough arc of a journey outward and inward, or they may enter anywhere and find their own coordinates. Either way, the book asks the same question from every angle: of all that we absorb from the places we inhabit — their light, their weather, their particular silences — what, when we finally hold still, turns out to have become us?</div>
