        <div class='book-intro'>Skyler Johnson was ninety-one years old when he finished arranging these poems, sitting in a garden in Kathmandu that he had been tending for nearly two decades. He did not write them in order. He wrote them the way a life accumulates — sideways, in layers, with the oldest material surfacing unexpectedly through the newest. San Francisco came back to him in the smell of cedar smoke. Austin returned in the particular weight of wet soil. Bogotá arrived without warning, the way rain does. This collection is the record of that surfacing: 250 haiku gathered across a lifetime of cities, climates, and selves, arranged now into the shape of a single long morning.

The book does not ask you to read it as a memoir, though it is one. It asks something quieter — that you notice how a body carries its geographies long after the moving is done, how the hands remember what the mind has filed away, how cold that came from the sea and cold that descended from ice are not the same cold, even when they settle in the same bones. Johnson has spent ninety-one years learning the difference between a place you have left and a place that has left you. His answer, worked out in syllables over decades, is that the distinction may not hold.

The seven sections that follow trace an arc — from the fog-softened half-memory of early San Francisco, through the heat and intellectual restlessness of Austin, the green labor of Bogotá, the philosophical loosening of late middle age, the unexpected rightness of Kathmandu, and finally into the long, unhurried light of a morning that no longer needs to be anywhere else. Readers may find themselves moving through these pages the way Johnson moved through his life: not always knowing where they are, but recognizing, with some surprise, that they have been here before.</div>
