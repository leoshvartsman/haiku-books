        <div class='book-intro'>These poems were made in the margins of a working life — on scaffolding and in workshops, in transit between languages, in the particular silence that follows a father&#x27;s frozen image on a screen. *Grain and Altitude* moves through the physical world with a craftsman&#x27;s attention: the flat edge of a carpenter&#x27;s pencil finding a truer line than intended, sawdust still settling at dusk, a linden branch bent low under nothing visible but cold. If there is a governing faith in this collection, it is that the material world — wood, water, the half-inch sway of scaffold in November wind — tells us something we cannot quite arrive at through intention alone.

But these are also poems of displacement and translation, in the broadest sense of those words. Robin Ali writes from the position of someone who has lived across languages and geographies, who knows the particular comedy and ache of being laughed at, not unkindly, for saying *madera* when the room expected *wood* or *Holz*. The collection holds all three. Dreams arrive in languages rarely used; a father&#x27;s mouth freezes mid-sentence and the speaker fills in the word from memory or hope. Throughout, the question of what we carry across borders — of culture, of vocation, of grief — runs quietly beneath the surface, the way a river is still present after fog has lifted and only the heron marks where it was.

What binds these two hundred and fifty poems together is not a single subject but a quality of attention: patient, precise, and willing to let go. The grip loosens. The scaffold steadies. The water forgets the geese and goes smooth again. Ali&#x27;s haiku do not resolve so much as they open — into the next moment, the next uncertainty, the next thing that turns out to be truer than planned.</div>
