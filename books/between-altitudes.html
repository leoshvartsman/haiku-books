        <div class='book-intro'>Geography is not just about maps—it lives in the body, in the way altitude changes your breathing, in how your feet remember the particular slant of childhood streets. These haiku trace a life lived between elevations, from the thin air of Andean mornings to the salt-heavy breath of coastal middle age. They are fragments of a journey that spans continents and decades, capturing the small moments that accumulate into a life: frost melting on schoolgirl palms, monsoon rain blurring ledger numbers, the weight of a new surname on official documents. This collection maps the territories we carry within us long after we&#x27;ve left them behind—the muscle memory of work, the accent that surfaces in dreams, the way certain weather brings back entire seasons of being someone else, somewhere else. Between these altitudes, between the mountain-born child and the coast-dwelling adult, lies the country of becoming: uncertain, immersive, transformative, and ultimately, grateful for every elevation along the way.</div>
