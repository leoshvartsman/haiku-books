        <div class='book-intro'># Introduction Welcome to this collection of 250 haiku—a journey through seasons, moments, and the quiet revelations that emerge when we pause to truly observe the world around us. Haiku, the beloved Japanese poetic form, captures entire universes in just seventeen syllables. Traditionally arranged in three lines of five, seven, and five syllables, these poems have been distilling human experience for over four centuries. Classical haiku often feature a seasonal reference (kigo) and a cutting word (kireji) that creates a pause or shift in meaning, inviting readers to complete the thought with their own imagination and experience. This anthology honors both traditional elements and contemporary innovations. You&#x27;ll find poems that strictly follow the 5-7-5 pattern alongside others that prioritize the haiku spirit over syllable counting—what matters most is the essence: a moment of insight, a flash of connection between inner and outer worlds, the art of saying much with little. The collection unfolds through four seasonal sections, following the ancient Japanese practice of organizing haiku by the natural calendar. Spring&#x27;s emergence and renewal give way to summer&#x27;s abundance, followed by autumn&#x27;s transformation and winter&#x27;s contemplative stillness. This structure isn&#x27;t merely organizational—it reflects haiku&#x27;s deep roots in seasonal awareness and the Buddhist concept of impermanence. These haiku emerged through an AI-assisted creative process, where technology served as both collaborator and curator. Each poem was carefully selected for its ability to create that distinctive haiku moment—the sudden recognition, the gentle surprise, the sense of something larger glimpsed through something small. How might you engage with this collection? Some readers prefer to move chronologically through the seasons, experiencing the full cycle of change. Others open randomly, letting chance guide them to whatever poem needs to be encountered. You might read one haiku per day, allowing time for each image to settle and resonate. Or perhaps read several at once, noticing how they speak to each other across the white spaces. Remember that haiku are participatory poems—they require your active engagement to complete their meaning. Don&#x27;t rush past the images. Let a cherry blossom, a summer storm, or morning frost expand in your mind. Notice what memories, feelings, or insights arise. The best haiku create a bridge between the poet&#x27;s observation and your own experience. Whether you&#x27;re new to haiku or a longtime reader, may these small poems offer you moments of pause, recognition, and wonder. In our hurried world, they remind us that poetry—and insight—can be found in the briefest encounters with beauty, change, and the eternal now. *Cameron Brown* Spring arrives not with fanfare, but with whispers—the soft unfurling of new leaves, the gentle steam rising from a morning cup of tea, the way light shifts and lengthens through our windows. This collection of seventy-eight haiku captures spring&#x27;s quiet revelations, those fleeting moments when the world seems to exhale after winter&#x27;s long pause. Many of these poems center around tea—that ancient ritual that transforms simple leaves and water into ceremony. Here, the morning tea becomes a meditation, a bridge between seasons, a way of honoring both the day&#x27;s beginning and spring&#x27;s renewal. The poets find sacred ground in everyday gestures: sunlight filtering through bamboo, mist rising from gardens, the first tender buds breaking through winter&#x27;s grip. These haiku remind us that spring&#x27;s true magic lies not in grand gestures, but in small awakenings—the way morning light slants differently, how silence carries new possibilities, the profound peace found in a single, mindful sip. Each poem invites us to pause, breathe, and witness the season&#x27;s gentle unfolding.</div>
