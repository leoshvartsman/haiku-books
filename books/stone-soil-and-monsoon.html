        <div class='book-intro'>A landscape architect spends a life learning to read the earth — its grades and drainages, its buried foundations, its insistence on going its own way regardless of what the plan says. Alex Colombo has practiced that reading across five decades and as many continents, from the travertine terraces of Rome where he first understood that beauty could be structural, to the frost-heaved pastures of Vermont where he learned that patience is a form of precision, to the monsoon-drenched streets of Mumbai where, late in life, he discovered that disorientation can be a kind of gift. This collection is the residue of that long attention — 250 haiku written not as a record of places visited but as proof that certain moments of contact between a person and a landscape leave marks that outlast the survey stakes.

Haiku suited Colombo the way a hand level suits a hillside: it finds the true horizontal quickly, without fuss. The form&#x27;s compression mirrors the compression of professional habit — the trained eye that takes in a slope, a soil color, a water stain on stone and knows, in an instant, what has been happening there for centuries. But haiku also enforces a kind of surrender that drafting tables do not. You cannot revise the fog. You cannot regrade the moment the bear crossed the field. What the form demanded, and what these poems ultimately offer, is the discipline of staying inside a single perception long enough to let it mean something without forcing it to mean anything in particular.

The seven sections of this book move roughly chronologically — boyhood in Italy, young adulthood in American cities, the long middle years of practice in New England, and a retirement that turned out to be an opening rather than a closing — but the movement is less a timeline than a terrain. The same themes recur the way water finds the same low path through a field after every rain: what we inherit and what we earn, what the body knows that the mind arrives at late, what it means to shape a place and be shaped by it in return. Readers who come to this book as gardeners, as architects, as travelers, or simply as people who have ever pressed a palm flat to warm stone and felt it press back, will find their own coordinates here.</div>
