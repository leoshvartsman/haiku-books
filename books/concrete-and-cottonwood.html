        <div class='book-intro'>Jamie White has always lived in two registers at once: the world as it is sold to us, and the world as it insists on being. Concrete and Cottonwood moves between Denver and New Orleans, between a sales floor and a workshop porch, between the person who had a quota and the person who learned to stand still long enough to watch an anole&#x27;s throat flash red. These haiku are the record of that education — not a dramatic conversion, but a slow, persistent noticing, the kind that happens when the living world refuses to wait for your attention and simply takes it. A cottonwood seed drifts through a July alley. A weed finds the crack where the handicap sign sank. The river decides something. You were already watching.</div>

        <div class='sample-haiku'><h2>Sample Haiku</h2><div class="haiku"><p>cottonwood seeds float</p><p>through the alley like slow snow—</p><p>July, not December</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>a weed finds the crack</p><p>where the handicap sign sank—</p><p>I find my quota</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>the night after workshop</p><p>I find a stranger&#x27;s line in</p><p>my own handwriting</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>the egret lifts off</p><p>the flooded neutral ground shifts</p><p>nothing explains this</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>the fig&#x27;s purple skin</p><p>tight until it isn&#x27;t tight—</p><p>August keeps its word</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>dreamed I was winded</p><p>walking to the corner store—</p><p>woke grateful for flat</p></div>
