        <div class='book-intro'>Four Dawns Rising traces the geography of a life lived between languages, continents, and the shifting definitions of home. These haiku emerge from the spaces between—between childhood and adulthood, between leaving and arriving, between the names we inherit and the ones we choose. Each poem is a small meditation on displacement and belonging, capturing moments when the familiar becomes foreign and the foreign slowly transforms into something resembling home. Like the four dawns that mark the cardinal directions, this collection moves through the landscapes of memory: from the volcanic shores of New Zealand through the urban sprawl of Melbourne, into the flour-dusted rhythms of an Indian village, across the Mediterranean&#x27;s ancient stones, and finally to the acceptance that home might not be a place but a practice—the daily ritual of making meaning from the fragments of all the places we&#x27;ve loved and left behind.</div>
