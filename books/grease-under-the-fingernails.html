        <div class='book-intro'>Arjun Desai learned to read engines before he learned to read cities. This collection moves through four of them — Mumbai, Miami, Calgary, Johannesburg — not as a travelogue but as a kind of body-log, a record of what the hands absorb when the mind is still catching up. The haiku form suits this project precisely: it is a tool built for the interval between perception and understanding, for the moment when something has already happened to you and you are only now beginning to know what it was. Desai works in that interval the way a mechanic works in the space between diagnosis and repair — patiently, with calibrated pressure, trusting that the click of recognition will come.

The title is not metaphorical, or not only. Grease under the fingernails is a fact of the life this book documents — the apprenticeship years, the long days under hoods in humid parking lots, the residency where a ratchet and a line break turned out to share a grammar. But it is also the book&#x27;s central argument: that knowledge lives in the body first, that displacement is not erasure but accumulation, that a person can carry four cities in one pair of hands and still be, in some essential way, one person. These poems do not mourn the distances between Desai&#x27;s selves. They measure them, the way you measure torque — with attention, with respect for what might break if you push too hard, and with the quiet confidence that the right amount of force will hold.</div>
