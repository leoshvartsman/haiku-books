        <div class='book-intro'>Xia Zhao has spent eight decades arriving. Born in Shanghai, she has lived beside the Hudson, beneath Norwegian mountains, and on the Ōta River delta — the same delta where, in August 1945, the river ran with the dead. This collection does not explain that life so much as hold it up to light, the way water holds whatever falls into it: without judgment, without forgetting. The haiku gathered here are not memories exactly. They are the residue of attention — what remains when a woman who has learned to see precisely turns her gaze on the places and people that have shaped her, and on the body that has carried all of it this far.

Water is the book&#x27;s recurring witness. The Huangpu carries the smell of her grandmother&#x27;s kitchen. The Hudson is gray in a way that took years to name. The Norwegian fjords taught her a kind of silence she had not known was available. The Ōta asks nothing and receives everything. Zhao does not romanticize displacement or arrive at easy reconciliation with it. What she offers instead is something rarer: the record of a consciousness that has learned, across four languages and eight decades, to pay very close attention to whatever ground it stands on — not because the ground belongs to her, but because she is here, and the light is doing something extraordinary, and there is still time to notice.</div>
