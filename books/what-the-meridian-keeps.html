        <div class='book-intro'>Valentín García has spent eighty-eight years standing beneath different skies, and this book is what those skies left behind. Born beside the Río de la Plata, educated in the Tennessee hills, seasoned by the Arabian Gulf, and finally stilled in Paris, García has lived what cartographers might call a life of extreme longitude — a life whose coordinates keep changing while something at the center holds. What the Meridian Keeps is his attempt to name that something, written in the only form he trusts to hold silence without breaking it.

Haiku suited him, he has said, because it does not explain. It arrives, it witnesses, it steps back. For a man who has moved between four languages and found each one capable of saying things the others cannot reach, there is relief in a form that asks only seventeen syllables and then goes quiet. These poems were composed across decades and revised across continents, some scratched in field notebooks during sandstorms, others written on café napkins in a hand growing less certain but no less precise. They are not a memoir. They are something closer to a record of attention — proof that a man was present, that he looked, that the world looked back.

The collection moves roughly in the order a life moves: from the prelinguistic warmth of childhood through the cold clarities of becoming, across deserts and thresholds and autumnal European light, and finally into the luminous stillness of great age. But García resists the tidiness of pure chronology. Memory, he knows, does not file itself by year. It files itself by quality of light, by the smell of a particular dust, by the specific weight of a silence that felt, once, like an answer. Readers who follow him through these seven sections will find not a life summarized but a life accumulated — every sky still present, every river still running somewhere beneath the skin.</div>
