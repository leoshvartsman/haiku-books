        <div class='book-intro'># Introduction Welcome to this collection of 250 haiku that bridge the timeless beauty of traditional Japanese poetry with the fresh perspectives of our digital age. In these pages, you&#x27;ll discover moments of wonder captured in just seventeen syllables—from cherry blossoms dancing in spring winds to frost painting winter windows, from the familiar rhythms of nature to the unexpected poetry found in modern life. Haiku, born in 17th-century Japan, represents one of the world&#x27;s most distilled forms of poetry. Traditionally structured in three lines of five, seven, and five syllables, these brief verses seek to capture a single moment in time, often featuring nature imagery and a seasonal reference called *kigo*. The best haiku create what Japanese poets call *mono no aware*—a bittersweet awareness of the impermanence of all things. Yet within this ancient form lies remarkable flexibility, allowing contemporary poets to explore urban landscapes, technology, and modern emotions while honoring the essence of haiku&#x27;s contemplative spirit. This anthology embraces both traditional and contemporary approaches to the form. You&#x27;ll find classical nature observations alongside haiku that reflect our connected, fast-paced world. Some adhere strictly to the 5-7-5 syllable pattern, while others prioritize the haiku&#x27;s deeper principles: compression, immediacy, and the power of suggestion over explanation. These poems emerged through an innovative collaboration between human creativity and artificial intelligence, with each haiku carefully curated and refined to ensure it captures that essential haiku moment—the pause that makes us see the world anew. This process has yielded verses that span the full spectrum of human experience while maintaining the form&#x27;s meditative quality. The collection follows the traditional Japanese seasonal progression, beginning with spring&#x27;s renewal and moving through summer&#x27;s abundance, autumn&#x27;s reflection, and winter&#x27;s stillness. Each season contains dozens of haiku that explore its unique moods, imagery, and emotions. This organization invites you to experience the year&#x27;s full cycle, but feel free to wander between seasons as your mood guides you. Consider reading slowly, allowing each haiku to settle in your mind before moving to the next. Some readers prefer to focus on one season at a time, while others enjoy the surprise of random discovery. You might read several haiku in sequence to create your own poetic journey, or pause with a single verse that speaks to you, letting its images unfold throughout your day. Whether you&#x27;re new to haiku or a longtime lover of the form, these brief encounters with beauty, insight, and wonder await your attention. In our hurried world, haiku reminds us that profound meaning often dwells in the smallest moments—if we simply pause long enough to notice. **Spring** Spring arrives not with fanfare, but with quiet insistence—sap rising in maple veins, steam curling from compost piles, the earth&#x27;s slow exhale after winter&#x27;s held breath. These eleven haiku capture spring&#x27;s essential paradox: beauty born from breaking, sweetness drawn from wounds, new life emerging from decay. Here, the Vermont sugar maple becomes both metaphor and reality, its clear blood flowing into waiting buckets while teaching us that transformation often requires vulnerability. The compost pile steams with promise, banana peels and coffee grounds composing tomorrow&#x27;s abundance. This is spring&#x27;s honest magic—not the greeting card version of pastel blooms, but the muddy, vital work of renewal. Each poem in this collection finds wonder in the season&#x27;s ordinary miracles: the steady drip that becomes syrup, the decomposition that feeds hope, the tender shoots that push through last year&#x27;s leaves. Spring asks us to witness these small resurrections, to find the sacred in the cycle of death and rebirth that plays out in every backyard, every forest, every moment when winter finally loosens its grip.</div>
