        <div class='book-intro'>Concrete and Lava begins underground. Before the first poem, there is pressure — the kind that builds in rock, in bodies, in systems of power that have been load-bearing for so long that no one remembers who laid the first stone. Riley Santos writes from the position of someone who has mixed the mortar and read the blueprints, who knows that a foundation is also a burial, that what gets poured into the ground shapes everything that rises above it. These are poems made with a construction worker&#x27;s precision and a volcanic patience: they wait, they measure, they know when the needle is about to move.

This collection moves across continents and atmospheres — from the geothermal unease of the earth&#x27;s own politics, through the scaffolded cities of West Africa and South America, into the cold grids of the global north — but it is always anchored in the body. Calloused hands. Boot leather stained with laterite. The specific weight of wet sand. Santos does not write about labor from a distance; the poems themselves are made the way buildings are made, through repetition and physical intelligence, each seventeen-syllable structure load-bearing in its own right. The haiku form, with its demand for compression and its tolerance for rupture, turns out to be the perfect blueprint for what Santos is building here.

By the final section, the collection has crossed the Atlantic in several directions and arrived somewhere that is not quite home and not quite exile — a place the speaker has assembled from stamps and crossings and the smell of mangoes carried on cold wind. Concrete and Lava is a book about who builds the world and who is built into it, about the thin crust between the ordinary and the catastrophic, and about what it means to press your palm to something cold and feel, unmistakably, that something moves below.</div>
