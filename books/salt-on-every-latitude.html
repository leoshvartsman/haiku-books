        <div class='book-intro'>Cedar and Cordite 1. fig split by noon heat — the pink mouth of a country I cannot close 2. jasmine through the crack — my mother&#x27;s wrist, her humming, plaster dust on sill 3. cedar on the slope holds snow it will not remember 4. limestone wall at dusk the call bends around a corner and finds me still there 5. Mediterranean — even the word takes too long to reach the shore 6. summer fig, blood-warm, eaten standing in the yard — no plate, no witness 7. jasmine opens late — somewhere a child is sleeping through the shelling still 8. cracked plaster, white dust — the wall keeps its own record of heat, of pressure 9. Beirut shoreline, blue — I say this word in Reykjavik and the fog lifts once 10. split fig on the step — ants have found it before me, small red congregation 11. the cedar stands where the mapmaker drew a border — it does not move south 12. call to prayer at four — the dark above the rooftops rings like a struck bowl 13. my mother&#x27;s garden: jasmine she tied with torn cloth, figs she would not sell 14. Mediterranean light falls differently on rubble — still, it falls as light 15. the shore holds nothing, gives nothing back but the sound of what it swallowed 16. plaster wall in sun, the crack runs from roof to earth like a family line 17. summer in Beirut — the fig tree asked no questions, offered only figs 18. I carry the fig the way you carry a name someone gave you young 19. jasmine root splits stone — the tenderness of small things breaking what is hard 20. from Reykjavik&#x27;s grey, I reach back for the cedar — my hand comes back cold 21. limestone in the rain, the street smelling of iron, old water, old salt 22. the fig tree in July: too much sweetness, too much sun, too much everything 23. a crack in the wall wide enough for one finger — I measured it once 24. cedar pollen, gold, drifting over the ravine — no one to name it 25. the shore at midnight, the Mediterranean black — my father swam here 26. jasmine after rain: the smell arrives before I remember to grieve 27. prayer before sunrise, the whole city breathing in — then breathing back out 28. fig tree, fig shadow, the summer I turned seven — I was only thirst 29. the cedar&#x27;s slow year: ring by ring, disaster made readable wood 30. plaster falls in sheets, the wall beneath is older, the wall beneath, pale 31. Beirut light on glass — I keep confusing windows for invitations 32. the call threads the streets the way a river threads stone — patient, without hands 33. jasmine on the sill, white against the dark outside — a small held candle 34. I named the fig tree. I have forgotten the name. The tree has not asked. 35. cedar in winter holds its shape against the snow — this is its whole work 36. split fig, open heart — the seeds arranged like a thought you cannot unthink 37. jasmine, cracked plaster, the smell of bread from below — a whole life, one floor 38. limestone at midday white enough to make you blind — I squinted for years The Name I Chose 39. lamination seal, my thumb across the photo— who approved this face 40. the clerk spells García twice, corrects herself, looks up— I say yes, that one 41. García—three vowels opening like small rooms I can finally rent 42. the notary stamped García into the paper— the sound: a small door 43. old passport photo— the name printed there belongs to someone still wet 44. workshop table strewn with crossed-out drafts—I keep one word from the old life 45. dusk on the iron staircase—someone else&#x27;s smoke, someone else&#x27;s name 46. the old signature won&#x27;t come out right anymore— my hand knows something 47. November pigeons on the workshop windowsill— they have no surnames 48. Reykjavik later— but first this November bridge, this river, this Smith 49. crossing the Hudson I surface: García 50. fire escape, November, a woman hangs laundry out— names on the waistbands 51. the photo booth said: remove glasses, face forward— I kept the glasses 52. new name, same coffee order at the same counter— the cup says Casey 53. last draft of the night, the fire escape gone dark now— I leave the name in 54. November river, grey as a held breath—I watch my new name fog glass 55. the Hudson carries whatever I throw in it— I throw in Smith first 56. in the margins of my draft, the old name surfaces— I let it stay there 57. new passport, same eyes— the photo booth light forgave nothing, as before 58. dusk iron, dusk rust— the fire escape holds the weight of my standing here 59. the laminate edge of the old card, peeling back— I help it along 60. in Dhaka I learned to spell myself in others&#x27; mouths—good training 61. fire escape at dusk, the city going amber— I am going too 62. the Hudson in fog, the far bank almost invented— I take notes on this 63. French for becoming, Bengali for arrival— English holds neither 64. workshop window frost, the instructor says: be precise— I write my new name 65. a word in Bengali for the self that watches you become—no English 66. workshop draft, red ink— someone has circled the word self twice, questioning 67. Arabic has no letter for the sound I make when I sign García 68. workshop lights at dusk, someone reads a poem aloud— it sounds like crossing Monsoon Ledger 69. low tide, the river shows its mud ribs one by one— I count what I owe 70. before the bells ring a rickshaw cuts through white fog— the street swallows it 71. jute drying on rope the whole block smells of earth pulled tight against itself 72. bougainvillea spills over rusted iron— the roof holds, barely 73. pre-dawn, the fog sits on the Buriganga&#x27;s back like an unpaid debt 74. the sales ledger damp— ink spreading at the margins into something soft 75. corrugated roofs catch the first rain and answer in a hundred tongues 76. jute smell in my coat months after I left Dhaka— grace I didn&#x27;t ask 77. the rickshaw man sleeps mid-route, feet still on the pedals— the bell does not ring 78. low water reveals a sandal, a rusted tin— the river forgets 79. humid August noon even the crows have given up their argument 80. I ring a doorbell on a lane I have rung twice a week for nine years 81. bougainvillea does not ask permission— it takes the whole wall 82. fog on the river— somewhere a boatman is rowing without seeing shore 83. the jute field at dawn each stalk beaded with water— I stop selling things 84. a customer laughs at something I have not said— the heat explains it 85. between two rainfalls a single hour of stillness— I eat, I do not speak 86. iron roof at night the rain sounds like someone counting money very fast 87. the Buriganga low and bronze in afternoon— I check my figures 88. rickshaw bells at four— the city starts its engines before the sky does 89. I have a route here the way water has a route— neither of us chose 90. pink against grey rust— bougainvillea does not know how tired I am 91. jute drying in rows the sun pulls something from it I cannot name yet 92. the fog this morning thicker than yesterday&#x27;s fog— I leave earlier 93. a woman hangs cloth over corrugated iron— the colour holds 94. Buriganga mud the colour of my ledger at the end of March 95. the bells I have heard so many mornings they are now inside my ribs 96. damp paper, damp pen— I sign my name in a room that smells of river 97. the route again— the tailor, the tea stall, the turn where the dog waits 98. low tide at midday a kingfisher lands, looks, leaves— the mud remembers 99. jute in the sunlight releasing what the river put inside it once 100. exhaustion so old it has grown comfortable— the fog understands 101. corrugated rust blooming with bougainvillea— I note this, move on 102. the rickshaw man hums something I half recognise— Arabic, or not 103. before the rains break the air becomes a held breath— my shirt sticks to me 104. Buriganga low— the far bank visible now as a kind of fact 105. fog so thick at five the bells arrive before the rickshaw does 106. a child runs the roof above corrugated iron— the whole street rings 107. jute smell and diesel— the morning has decided what kind it will be 108. I write the totals in a book no one will read— the river also 109. the heat is patient in a way that I am not— it will still be here 110. bougainvillea: even its name is excess— still, I am glad 111. low water, a heron standing in the Buriganga as if it owns debt 112. the route is a rope I have pulled so long my palms have learned its texture 113. fog lifting slowly over corrugated roofs— the pink is still pink What the River Carries 114. silt on my palms— I count the years like a man counts unfamiliar coins 115. the vendor&#x27;s fingers sort bronze from silver, never once looking at me 116. brown water rising past a child&#x27;s knee, past her hem— she does not stop laughing 117. what the river keeps: a sandal, a newspaper, someone&#x27;s name in ink 118. midnight, the mirror shows a man I almost know— the light here is cold 119. dried mango rind curled on the sill like a letter no one thought to send 120. the flood carries what the flood decides to carry— I learned this early 121. a child holds her skirt above the brown water, wades toward nothing I see 122. hotel mirror, 2 a.m.— my Arabic comes back in the shape of thirst 123. the vendor&#x27;s left thumb worn smooth on its inner edge— a life of small change 124. silt settles the way grief does, at the bottom, quiet, making weight 125. mango rind blackens on the sill while I sleep through another strange dawn 126. children in the street waist-deep in muddy water— the city becomes sea 127. I wiped the mirror then stood in the wet handprint watching it vanish 128. the coin passes through four hands before it reaches the vendor&#x27;s wooden box 129. floodwater carries the scent of somewhere upstream— I have never been 130. she counts her coins twice, the vendor, small and certain— rain on the awning 131. what silt remembers: the shape of the riverbed before the water rose 132. a mango rind left before—I don&#x27;t ask 133. the children&#x27;s voices rise above the brown water— the water rises too 134. midnight mirror holds the window behind my head: a city I&#x27;ve rented 135. the vendor wraps coins in a square of newspaper— monsoon has softened it 136. silt-colored morning, the river neither leaving nor arriving yet 137. I find mango rind dried to leather on the sill— I leave it. I know 138. a boy balances a cardboard box on his head, wading, concentrated 139. the mirror at night doubles the single bare bulb— two rooms, both empty 140. her hands count change fast, the way a woman counts days until something ends 141. what the water brings from somewhere I cannot name— I add it to the list 142. children in the flood have turned the street into theirs— the adults detour 143. silt is a record of everything the rain touched on its way down here 144. the vendor&#x27;s thumbnail split at the base, an old wound— he counts on regardless 145. one child carries another through brown water on her back— the smaller one laughs Geothermal 146. steam lifts from the street I mistake it for cooking— no pot, no kitchen 147. the tern drops hard, fast a blade the harbour didn&#x27;t ask for, then gone 148. black rock holds the snow the way a bruise holds colour longer than it should 149. June light at midnight I check my watch three times, then give the watch away 150. moss the colour of nothing I was taught to name— I lean in closer 151. tern cry over masts— sharper than a call to prayer, just as unanswered 152. lava field in snow: dark vowels under white cloth, the land still speaking 153. I came with four tongues and stand here mute before steam that needs no language 154. the sun slung so low it lights my face from the side— I feel inspected 155. first week: I boiled the tap water out of habit from another life 156. moss grips the black stone the way a word in Arabic grips the back of teeth 157. harbour seals surface, watch me watching them, then sink without a verdict 158. the geothermal pipe runs beneath the whole city— warmth no one earned 159. snow on lava crust— two violences cooling into something still 160. the tern dives again, ignoring every border I brought here with me 161. at midsummer dusk that is not dusk, I forget which meal I am on 162. a crack in black rock holds a fist of bright-green moss— this is how you hold 163. steam column rising straight up in the windless cold, the city exhaling 164. I walk the lava field slowly—each step a question the rock doesn&#x27;t rush 165. the sun skims the ridge, reconsiders, skims again— it cannot commit 166. Arctic tern hovers, its red beak a small alarm no one else heeds here 167. the moss is ancient— older than the name I took, older than the war 168. geothermal warmth rising through the bathroom floor— I sit down on it 169. a tern egg, spotted, nested in the black rubble— I back away slow 170. snow fills the lava&#x27;s hollows, each one a small bowl offered up to whom 171. light that will not end: I find myself apologising to the dark I miss 172. the harbour at six a.m.—same light as six p.m.—I lose the seam 173. black rock, white snow, grey steam—a palette so stripped down I forget cedar 174. I press my palm flat on the warm pavement—something pulses back, not mine 175. the lava field ends where the lava field ends—no gradual goodbye 176. in Icelandic the word for steam and the word for ghost share a breathing 177. June: the birds are loud with a purpose I cannot translate or decline 178. moss holds the rainwater in its dense grey-green fleece— drinks without a mouth 179. the tern&#x27;s dive is not graceful—it is accurate, which is harder 180. steam from a grate, then a woman walks through it, then the street is just street Walking the Lava Fields 181. purple crowns the black— lupine pushing through old fire one inch at a time 182. the ptarmigan stands half-brown, half-white, mid-October— the field cannot choose 183. northern lights begin not with colour but a sound my boots stop walking 184. whale spout dissolves slow into the grey dusk water— I counted to three 185. frost from inside out— my breath has been building this small white world all night 186. lupine after rain the purple gone almost blue— I kneel in the mud 187. ptarmigan feather caught in basalt crack at noon— no bird anywhere 188. green curtain above I walk the gravel until my neck aches with it 189. the whale&#x27;s second spout further out than the first was— dusk is doing this 190. my window ferns out in frost while I sleep—I wake to a forest gone 191. lupine in a row following the lava&#x27;s edge like they know the rule 192. white bird, white hillside— only the eye&#x27;s movement tells which part is alive 193. I stop on the path the lights shift from green to white— gravel under boots 194. low tide, no whale yet— I have been standing here long enough to grow cold 195. the frost writes inward from the corners of the glass— old script I can&#x27;t read 196. a single lupine in the crack of a lava ridge— the crack was first 197. ptarmigan in snow exactly the size of snow that is not moving 198. the aurora bends around something I can&#x27;t see— the field accepts it 199. spout on the skyline then nothing for so long that I invent a second 200. three a.m. window— the frost completes its sentence before I can read 201. lupine after frost the purple not quite purple— close enough to mourn 202. between brown and white the ptarmigan holds its ground on the grey gravel 203. I walk the lava with no destination set— the path disagrees 204. the whale does not breach— only that column of breath briefly vertical 205. frost thickens by one more petal while I watch it— I am very still 206. wind crosses the field and the lupine lean as one— they have practised this 207. ptarmigan calling somewhere in the white hillside— I answer nothing 208. the light moves sideways I was not ready for that— my shadow follows 209. after the spout fades the horizon stays the same as before it came 210. I breathe on the glass to clear it—the frost returns before I can look 211. lupine seed case, dry— I press it and nothing falls— already empty 212. half a white feather in basalt water at dusk— the other half gone 213. the aurora&#x27;s green reflected in a rain pool on the lava path 214. the whale breathes and dips— that is the whole of the thing I was given here 215. frost on the outside of my coat by the time home— I made this crossing 216. lupine in late wind the flowers closing slightly— still undeniably 217. ptarmigan tracks where no snow has fallen yet—mud holding what was white 218. I look up too late— the light has moved on without needing me to see 219. whale on the last light— I do not reach for my phone— this is for no one 220. the frost and the lamp— between them my window holds a world of white lines Salt on Every Latitude 221. García, written slowly — the accent mark sits where I put it now 222. four coastlines at once and none of them pulling hard — this is what peace weighs 223. the notebook I sold refrigerators in — now holds a heron&#x27;s cry 224. the moon over Dhaka rises again here — slower, whiter, more alone 225. a phrase in Arabic lands in the wrong season — snow fills the vowels 226. to write García in Arabic script, slowly — the letters accept it 227. salt on the cold glass — the Atlantic doesn&#x27;t ask which shore I came from 228. in French, I count waves — in Bengali, I name the cold — English holds the rest 229. I cross out Smith lightly — not erased, just carried under the new name 230. to carry four places lightly — not to set them down, not to be crushed 231. García in full — the tilde above the n is not a question 232. the moon completes its round — Beirut, New York, Dhaka, here — I did not rush it 233. I think in Arabic but the sentence bends toward Icelandic cold 234. between two oceans a woman named herself twice and both names hold salt 235. in Reykjavik dark I conjugate a verb no language owns yet 236. the name fits better each decade — like a stone smoothed by the right river 237. an Arabic phrase that means &quot;settle down now&quot; — in Icelandic, no word fits 238. four latitudes of salt on one woman&#x27;s hands — she is washing them now 239. my name, rewritten in the four scripts I know — all of them are mine 240. salt at the cliff&#x27;s edge — the Atlantic smells almost like what I have lost 241. Smith became García — the Atlantic keeps no record of what a name costs 242. the word for longing in Arabic — I think it in Icelandic syntax 243. García, Smith, García — the pen decides nothing, only the hand 244. I reprice the page: not units sold but the light on a frozen fjord 245. the moon was over Beirut first — I always let it arrive here second 246. my notebook margin: a client&#x27;s phone in Dhaka, then a curlew, twice 247. the moon that left Dhaka pauses over Reykjavik — I let it rest here 248. the Mediterranean taught me salt first — the Atlantic taught me its distance 249. the moon arrives last in Reykjavik — I wait up, I always wait up 250. four cities, one moon: it rises over the one I do not grieve most</div>
