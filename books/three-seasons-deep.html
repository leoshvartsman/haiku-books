        <div class='book-intro'>Three cities. Three languages of rain. Three ways of marking time&#x27;s passage through the turning wheel of seasons. In &#x27;Three Seasons Deep,&#x27; the traditional Japanese concept of kigo—those precise seasonal markers that anchor haiku in the natural world—becomes a compass for navigating the geography of memory and belonging. These poems trace a journey from the rhododendron-scented mornings of Kathmandu through the fog-wrapped streets of London to the evergreen embrace of Seattle, where all seasons converge in the poet&#x27;s adopted heart. This is not simply a collection about places, but about the accumulation of selves we carry as we move through the world. Each section marks a different depth of settling: the bright wonder of childhood, the restless energy of discovery, the purposeful stride of career, the courage required for transformation, and finally, the quiet integration that comes with age and acceptance. Here, temple bells echo across decades, fountain pens skip through puddles of memory, and cherry blossoms fall equally on prayer stones and city sidewalks—because home, these poems suggest, is not a single place but the layered seasons we carry within us.</div>
