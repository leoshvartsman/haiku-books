        <div class='book-intro'>There is a particular kind of attention that belongs to people who have lived in more than one climate — a habit of watching the sky not for beauty but for information, of reading weather the way others read faces. Blake Kim developed this habit early, growing up between hemispheres, and later brought it into the therapy room, where the work is also, finally, about learning to read what surrounds you. Wet Season, Dry Season is the record of that double education: in landscape and in grief, in the patience that places demand and the patience that people require of each other.

Haiku, with its insistence on the present image and the seasonal word, turns out to be an ideal form for a life lived across meridians. The kigo — the traditional seasonal reference that anchors a haiku in time — assumes a shared climate, a common sky. This collection is partly a meditation on what happens when that assumption fails: when you are a tropical child learning to write about snow, a therapist sitting with suffering you cannot enter, a traveler crossing the dateline and losing the seam between one day and the next. The poems do not resolve this displacement so much as inhabit it, finding in the gap between languages and landscapes something that functions, quietly, like home.

The seven sections of this book move roughly chronologically — from childhood altitude in Ecuador through borrowed winters and the discipline of a therapy practice, through the bright vertigo of Carnaval and the long transit of international flight, to the monsoon rhythms of Singapore and finally to the open question of a life that refuses to be contained by any single seasonal vocabulary. But the movement is not only through time. It is the slow work named in the collection&#x27;s epigraph, the work of arriving: to a place, to a self, to the present moment — which is, the poems suggest, the only moment any landscape has ever offered us.</div>
