        <div class='book-intro'>Haiku has always been a form built for the displaced — for the person who stands at the edge of a field, a season, a life, and finds that the only honest response is compression. Morgan Moore has spent decades crossing borders: the border between Florida and Europe, between English and Spanish, between employment and its absence, between the country that shaped you and the country that keeps you. What the Unemployed Know is the record of that crossing, told in the seventeen-syllable units that suit it best — small containers under enormous pressure, the way a mangrove root holds mud, the way a held breath holds time.

These poems move through geography the way memory does: not in a straight line but by association, by the logic of weather and bureaucratic form and the particular quality of light on water in a place you can no longer call home. Haiku is sometimes misunderstood as a genre of serenity, of cherry blossoms and acceptable sadness. Moore refuses that misunderstanding. Here the form is used as it was always capable of being used — as a precision instrument, as a way of saying the unsayable by saying only what is exactly, undeniably there. A mosquito coil. A pen that runs out. A fence, and then another fence.

The title names something real: the unemployed, the displaced, the waiting — they know things that the busy and the settled do not. They know what a Tuesday morning looks like from the wrong side of it. They know the weight of a form with a blank where your life should be. They know how stillness, when it is imposed rather than chosen, becomes a kind of education. This book is that education, offered in the only form that does it justice.</div>
