        <div class='book-intro'>There is a particular kind of knowledge that lives in the gaps — between languages, between countries, between the note a musician plays and the silence that follows it. Jona Wagner has spent a life accumulating that knowledge: raised along the Isar in Munich, remade on the streets of Austin, shaped by the bureaucratic corridors of Berlin and the long highways of the Texas Hill Country. Between Measures is the record of that accumulation, written in the compressed, patient form of haiku — a form that has always understood that the space around a thing is part of the thing itself.

This collection moves the way a jazz standard moves: through familiar structures bent just enough to unsettle, through repetition that slowly becomes recognition, through the discovery that circling back to the same river or the same street corner is not the same as staying still. The haiku here do not announce their meanings. They set something down — a cold stone, a gray folder, a roadrunner crossing a parking lot — and trust the reader to feel the weight of it. That trust is itself a kind of homecoming.

Between Measures is arranged as a journey, though not a tidy one. It begins in the luminous, slightly aching light of childhood memory and moves outward through displacement, grief, music, history, and the wide ambivalence of late-life belonging, arriving finally at a stillness that has been genuinely earned. The hyphen between German and Texan, between then and now, between one language and another — Wagner does not resolve it. She learns, instead, to live inside it. These poems are what that living looks like.</div>
