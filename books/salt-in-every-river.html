        <div class='book-intro'>There is a particular kind of knowledge that lives below the neck — in the palms, the forearms, the back of the throat. Salt in Every River is a book built from that knowledge: the grease that doesn&#x27;t fully wash out, the cold of a window that gives nothing back, the way a monsoon smells different from November rain even when the body can&#x27;t immediately say why. These haiku were gathered across four cities — New York, Norwich, Mumbai, Dhaka — not as postcards but as pressure marks, the impressions left when a life leans hard against a place long enough to be changed by it. Riley King writes as a bilingual wanderer for whom home is not a location but an accumulation — of thresholds crossed, of languages half-held, of griefs that arrive only after departure. The collection moves chronologically through a life in motion, but its deeper movement is inward: from the restless, wide-eyed hunger of childhood through dislocation and immersion toward something quieter and harder to name, a kind of bodily wisdom that outlasts the addresses. Each section is a different climate, a different quality of light, a different register of longing. Haiku, with its insistence on the concrete and the present tense, turns out to be the ideal form for a life lived across distances. A pigeon&#x27;s red foot, a wrench slipping in forty-degree heat, the stain a jackfruit leaves on a board — these are not metaphors reaching toward meaning. They are the meaning, held briefly, the way you hold anything you know you will have to leave. Read this book as a single breath taken across many years and many soils. Notice what the body remembers when you reach the end.</div>
