        <div class='book-intro'>There is a kind of knowledge that accumulates not in the mind but in the body — the way a particular slant of afternoon light can trigger the anticipation of a fruit that grows on a different continent, or the way a cold morning in one city carries the memory of cold mornings in three others, all arriving at once, none of them wrong. Sky Singh has lived across four climates, and this collection is the record of what that does to a person: not displacement, exactly, but a multiplication of seasonal selves, each one trained to read the air, the light, the specific weight of a coming change. The haiku in these pages are acts of that reading — precise, patient, and often surprised by what they find.

The Patience of Thresholds moves through seven registers of time and attention, from the sensory sharpness of anticipation to the quiet integration of a self that has finally stopped demanding a single answer to the question of where it is. Along the way, the collection passes through the particular exhaustion of digital work, the liturgical calendars that rename the same moon, the protocols of flood country, and the strange tender comedy of southern-hemisphere autumn arriving from the wrong direction. Each section is its own climate. Together, they form something that belongs to no single place — a composite season, interior and wholly earned.</div>
