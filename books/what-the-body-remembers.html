        <div class='book-intro'>These two hundred and fifty haiku were written over seven years, in airport terminals and waiting rooms, at kitchen tables in three different cities, and occasionally on my phone while standing near things I didn&#x27;t want to forget — a flower cart, a chain-link fence with an orange tree behind it, a glass window I pressed my finger against to trace a character I was still learning to claim. The poems in *What the Body Remembers* are concerned with the way experience accumulates in the body before the mind has language for it: the specific weight of a plastic chair&#x27;s seam, the smell of eucalyptus oil that lingers past its occasion, the flat quality of light in a place that hasn&#x27;t yet decided what it means to you. They are also, quietly, poems about inheritance — what gets passed down through names and silence, through a mother&#x27;s certainty that the volcano is still there beneath the grey, through the kanji a person traces on glass with their left hand as if the glass might hold it.

The collection moves associatively rather than chronologically, following the logic of sensation and recurrence rather than narrative arc. Readers will find themselves in corporate spaces and open-air markets, in the suspended hour between tasks, in the long middle distance of belonging somewhere partially. There is humor here too — the brand deck slide, the seven deleted first lines — because the body&#x27;s memory is not always solemn. Sometimes it is absurd. Sometimes the most honest thing you can say about a moment is that you were there, that something fell still, and that you noticed.

What ties these poems together, I hope, is a quality of attention that refuses to settle too quickly into meaning. The haiku form has always asked its practitioners to hold the image a moment longer than is comfortable, to resist the explanatory turn, to let the thing remain a thing before it becomes a lesson. These poems try to honor that discipline while also acknowledging that some of us come to the form carrying questions about which traditions we are permitted to inhabit, which names we sounded out in books before we claimed them. The body remembers what the self is still negotiating. These poems live in that space.</div>
