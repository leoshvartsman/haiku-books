        <div class='book-intro'>These poems were made in the body before they were made on the page. They begin with bare feet on hot bitumen, with jacaranda stain and frost-printed grass, with the particular education of skin and sole that only a specific place, at a specific hour, can provide. *Longitude of Light* is a book about learning where you are — and, just as often, where you are not. The Southern Cross moves through the louvers. Orion is absent from his usual corner of the sky. The coordinates keep shifting, and the poems are the record of someone triangulating, again and again, between the familiar and the foreign, the hemisphere left behind and the one now underfoot.

What holds these 250 haiku together is not a single geography but a single quality of attention — patient, precise, and quietly restless. A woman sweeps a driveway as jacaranda falls; she sweeps again. A steam column rises straight into cold still air, and the watching goes on past the point where most people would look away. This is a collection that trusts the unresolved moment, the sentence that trails off mid-gesture, the footprints that lead to the water&#x27;s edge and stop. The engineer in these pages notices the function in a bird&#x27;s repeated call. The traveler buys boots and stands over a steaming grate and lets that be enough. There is discipline here, but it wears its discipline lightly.

Readers will move through seasons and latitudes, through schoolyards and street markets, through windows that frame wrong skies and rooftops where blue tanks wait for rain that the sky is already handling on its own. The tone shifts — sometimes wry, sometimes elegiac, sometimes simply awake in the way that early mornings demand — but the underlying sensibility remains constant: a belief that the world, looked at long enough and closely enough, will offer something true. These poems ask you to stand still for seventeen syllables. In return, they give you the longitude of a particular light, falling exactly here, at exactly this hour, once.</div>
