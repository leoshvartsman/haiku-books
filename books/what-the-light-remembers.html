        <div class='book-intro'>There is a kind of knowledge that cannot be carried in a suitcase — the knowledge the body accumulates as it moves through latitudes, as it learns to read weather in a new sky and find its footing on unfamiliar ground. What the Light Remembers is the record of one such body: a life that began among the grey harbors and wool-grey winters of Copenhagen and arrived, by routes both chosen and accidental, at the luminous disorder of São Paulo. Between those two cities lie decades of classrooms, mountain passes, languages half-learned and languages fully loved, and the long, patient work of becoming a person shaped by more than one place.

Haiku has always been a form suited to the threshold — the moment between seasons, between waking and sleep, between what we see and what we almost understand. In this collection, Sage Lee uses that threshold quality to trace not just a geography but an interior life: what it means to stand at the snow line and say nothing, to feel a father&#x27;s shape still held in the shoulders of an empty coat, to find that a city&#x27;s noise can remake a person who thought the work of remaking was long finished. These poems do not argue for any philosophy of travel or displacement. They simply attend — to light, to texture, to the small negotiations between a human body and the world it moves through.

What accumulates in a person who has walked so many different soils? These seven sections propose an answer that is less a conclusion than a quality of attention: a way of holding multiple weathers simultaneously without being torn apart by them. The light, Lee suggests, remembers everything — the herring scales on the dock boy&#x27;s fingers, the jacaranda fallen on the unbothered dog, the projector bulb still warm at the end of a thirty-year career. We move through the world; the world moves through us; and somewhere in that exchange, something luminous and patient is keeping count.</div>
