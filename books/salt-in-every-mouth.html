        <div class='book-intro'>Some lives are measured in years; this one is measured in water. Salt in Every Mouth moves through seven coastlines and as many selves, tracing the arc of a single body from a childhood pressed against the Bosphorus to an old age that finds the sea written into its own skin. Robin Andersson&#x27;s haiku do not document a journey so much as they preserve its residue — the mineral rings, the erased names, the grandmother&#x27;s pulse that may or may not have been one&#x27;s own. Each harbor here is less a destination than a sediment, something that stays long after the tide has gone.

These poems work in the haiku tradition&#x27;s native currency: the small, irreducible moment that refuses to be smaller than it is. A clerk&#x27;s slow keystrokes. Bougainvillea bleeding through glass at two in the morning. A vein surfacing on the back of a hand. Andersson trusts the particular — a specific yellow of hotel curtains, a specific blue of a strait — to carry what generalities cannot. The result is a collection that moves through geography and time without ever losing the weight of a single body moving through both.

Readers will find no tidy autobiography here, no chronology that resolves into arrival. What they will find is something more honest: the accumulation of selves that do not replace one another but layer, the way salt layers in rock, the way a language half-forgotten still shapes the mouth that speaks another. Salt in Every Mouth asks what we carry when we cross water, and what crosses with us whether we intended it to or not.</div>
