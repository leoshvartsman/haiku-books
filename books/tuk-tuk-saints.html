Iowa City frost etches patterns on my dorm window—winter writes End of Tuk-Tuk Saints ### [#104] &quot;Dhaka monsoon floods...&quot; The monsoon serves as both seasonal marker and urban transformer here. Chen captures how floods turn city streets into mirrors, creating an unexpected beauty from chaos. The juxtaposition between natural disaster and artificial light—neon signs becoming art in the water—shows how cities adapt and find grace in crisis. The &quot;rippling&quot; adds movement and impermanence, suggesting these reflected signs are as fleeting as they are beautiful. This haiku exemplifies Chen&#x27;s ability to find poetry in urban resilience. ### [#114] &quot;Dhaka power cut...&quot; The comparison of candlelit windows to &quot;grounded aircraft lights&quot; is brilliantly unexpected—turning a power outage into an airport metaphor. The city becomes a runway where nothing can take off, trapped by infrastructure failure. There&#x27;s both beauty and frustration in this image: candles provide intimate light while suggesting the larger systems that have failed. The sonic quality of &quot;flicker&quot; echoes the unsteady nature of both candlelight and unreliable power, while the aircraft metaphor hints at dreams deferred. ### [#168] &quot;Rush hour rickshaw...&quot; &quot;Physics of faith&quot; is a stunning phrase that captures the seeming impossibility of three-wheeled vehicles navigating floods. The dash after &quot;rickshaw&quot; creates a perfect pause, letting us visualize the precarious vehicle before the revelation of its near-miraculous movement. Chen juxtaposes scientific law with spiritual belief, suggesting that daily survival in Dhaka requires both practical skill and something beyond rational explanation. The rhythm mimics the rickshaw&#x27;s bumpy progress through impossible conditions. ### [#64] &quot;Monsoon sheet metal...&quot; This haiku transforms the harsh reality of tin roofing into a percussion concert. The alliteration of &quot;monsoon,&quot; &quot;metal,&quot; and &quot;music&quot; creates its own drumbeat, while &quot;sheet metal drums&quot; turns industrial materials into instruments. The progression from noise to sleep to music shows how we adapt to our environments, finding comfort in what might initially disturb. Chen&#x27;s use of present tense (&quot;becomes&quot;) captures the exact moment when annoyance transforms into lullaby—a perfect example of urban poetry. ### [#134] &quot;Power cuts at midnight...&quot; The personification of darkness as a writer is Chen&#x27;s masterstroke here. While humans lose the ability to write (no electric light), darkness gains agency and begins composing. The candles become punctuation marks in darkness&#x27;s text, flickering like uncertain words. There&#x27;s something both ominous and beautiful about darkness as author, suggesting that absence can be as creative as presence. The midnight timing adds to the literary atmosphere—the traditional hour for both writers and supernatural activity. ### [#209] &quot;Iowa snow fell...&quot; This haiku captures a pivotal moment where natural and artistic creation intersect. The visual contrast of white snow and black ink mirrors the blank page becoming filled with words. There&#x27;s a sense that the snow blessed or witnessed this literary milestone—the external winter matching the internal moment of artistic birth. &quot;White silence, black ink&quot; is particularly effective, suggesting both the quiet needed for creation and the bold act of breaking that silence with published words. ### [#67] &quot;Philadelphia snow...&quot; The image of childhood being carried to the sea through storm drains is both melancholy and inevitable. Chen uses the urban infrastructure—those mundane storm drains—as rivers of time, carrying away innocence. The snow&#x27;s melting becomes a metaphor for growing up: what was once solid and playful dissolves and flows away. There&#x27;s acceptance in this haiku, a recognition that cities are always washing away our past selves, carrying them toward something vast and unknowable. ### [#87] &quot;Philadelphia snow...&quot; Nearly identical to #67 but with &quot;my mother&#x27;s footprints&quot; replacing childhood—showing Chen&#x27;s experimental approach to variation. This version feels more specific and poignant, suggesting the traces our loved ones leave are as ephemeral as snow. The footprints imply presence and absence simultaneously: she was here, but now only impressions remain, and even those are melting away. The storm drains become a metaphor for memory itself, carrying away the physical evidence of those we love. ### [#179] &quot;Bengali script flows...&quot; Chen creates a beautiful parallel between ink and monsoon, both flowing forces that shape landscapes—one cultural, one natural. The fountain pen suggests both tradition and fluidity, while &quot;pools like monsoon&quot; connects the grandmother&#x27;s writing to the seasonal floods of her homeland. There&#x27;s something sacred about this image: the script doesn&#x27;t just sit on paper but flows and pools, becoming part of the natural world. The alliteration of &quot;fountain&quot; and &quot;flows&quot; adds to the liquid musicality. ### [#162] &quot;Cornfield maze swallows...&quot; The autumn setting provides perfect seasonal context for this meditation on academic transformation. Chen&#x27;s verb choice—&quot;swallows&quot;—makes the maze predatory, while &quot;whole&quot; suggests complete consumption. The final line&#x27;s paradox (&quot;changed, lost&quot;) captures the graduate school experience perfectly: you emerge different but also disoriented, educated but uncertain. The maze becomes a metaphor for academic pursuit itself—deliberately confusing, with the goal being transformation rather than simple escape. ### [#180] &quot;Cheese steak grease drips down...&quot; This haiku finds unexpected poetry in South Philly&#x27;s grittiness. The juxtaposition between greasy fast food and persistent dandelions creates a perfect urban nature moment—life pushing through despite (or because of) the city&#x27;s messiness. The vertical movement from dripping grease to upward-pushing flowers suggests resilience and renewal. Chen&#x27;s choice to focus on sidewalk cracks as the site of natural emergence shows how cities create their own ecosystems, finding beauty in the margins. ### [#112] &quot;Brisbane&#x27;s jacaranda...&quot; The purple petals create a carpet of beauty on an ordinary walk, transforming the mundane journey to &quot;the hangar&quot; into something ceremonial. Jacaranda season is Brisbane&#x27;s spring signature, and Chen captures how these trees briefly turn the city purple. The specific mention of &quot;the hangar&quot; adds intrigue—suggesting aircraft, industry, or storage—while the falling petals provide natural confetti for this daily ritual. The soft sounds of &quot;drops,&quot; &quot;purple,&quot; and &quot;petals&quot; mirror the gentle fall of flowers.</div>
