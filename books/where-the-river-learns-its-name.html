        <div class='book-intro'>A river does not know its name until it has traveled far enough to be named by someone else. The haiku in this collection follow one such journey — from the granite-cold coast of Maine, where a child learned to measure silence by the spaces between spruce trees, through the rain-soaked libraries of Manchester, the volcanic austerity of Iceland, and finally the monsoon-drenched streets of Dhaka, where the self that began on a tin-roofed shore discovered it had become something neither entirely new nor entirely lost. These are poems written in the breath-sized units that a displaced life actually moves in: not in chapters or declarations, but in flashes — a passport photo, a coin&#x27;s unfamiliar weight, a word heard in one language that secretly belongs to another.

Haiku has always been a form preoccupied with location — with the precise, unrepeatable quality of a moment in a particular place. For an immigrant, that preoccupation becomes something more urgent and more complicated. Every moment of arrival contains a ghost of departure. Every landscape is perceived through the scrim of another. Skyler Anderson works in this doubled attention, writing poems that are rooted in the sensory particulars of wherever the speaker stands while remaining quietly haunted by everywhere they have stood before. The form does not merely suit this subject; it insists upon it, refusing the immigrant narrative its usual consolations of linear progress and earned resolution.

What you will find here is not a story of loss redeemed or identity triumphantly reclaimed. It is something quieter and, we think, truer: a record of what the body holds onto without being asked, what the mind releases without meaning to, and what slowly, stubbornly grows in the space between the self that left and the self that stayed. By the final section, home has not been found so much as conjugated — into a grammar flexible enough to hold pine and basalt and monsoon, Maine and Reykjavík and Dhaka, all at once, all still present, none of them finished.</div>
