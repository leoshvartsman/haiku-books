        <div class='book-intro'>A river does not know its name until someone stands on its bank and gives it one. The same might be said of a life. Sacha Michel has lived across four cities and answered to two names, and this book is the slow record of what that does to a person — not the dramatic ruptures, but the quiet, cellular education of becoming permeable: to fog, to gravel, to rain-filled lanes, to the smell of a stranger&#x27;s coffee going cold beside you at a meeting where something urgent is at stake. These haiku do not argue for a philosophy of home. They practice one.

The collection moves roughly in time but not strictly — it spirals, the way memory does, the way a river bends back toward land it has already passed. Lyon gives way to Tokyo, Tokyo to Montreal, and between each city the white space of transit, that peculiar nowhere of altitude and suspension where a person is briefly no one&#x27;s neighbor and no country&#x27;s guest. What accumulates across these seven sections is not a map but a quality of attention: the slow discovery that belonging is less a place you arrive at than a habit of noticing you cultivate, until the sacred ordinary — a ginkgo leaf on a temple step, a grandmother&#x27;s hands, a flyer in four languages dissolving in March slush — becomes the only theology you need.

Michel writes in a tradition that has always understood this. The haiku form is itself an act of radical presence, a commitment to the particular over the general, the moment over the argument. To write seventeen syllables about fog you have tasted on the way to school is to insist that your body&#x27;s education matters, that the world enters us through small doors. Where the River Learns Its Name is a book about those doors — how many there are, how long they take to open, and what it means to finally stop counting them.</div>
