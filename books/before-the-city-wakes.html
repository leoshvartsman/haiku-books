        <div class='book-intro'>These poems were written in the dark. Not metaphorically — though that too — but literally, in the hour before cities remember themselves, when the street below is still deciding what it is and the body beside the window has not yet been asked to be anyone in particular. Over two decades and four cities, Jamie Rodriguez kept returning to that hour: the Bronx at five a.m., Tokyo in tsuyu drizzle, an Atlantic coast where the tide and the market moved on the same indifferent schedule, Nairobi where the hadada ibis screams the world awake before anyone has consented to morning. The haiku collected here are what that hour produced — small rectangles of attention, each one a breath held just long enough to see something clearly.

Belonging, this book argues quietly, is not a destination. It is a practice, and like most practices it is mostly failure punctuated by moments of almost unbearable precision. A pigeon that knows something you don&#x27;t. A bicycle seat holding rain like an offering. A mop tracing the same square of floor at three a.m. Rodriguez does not resolve the tension between the person who left and the cities that were left, between languages that are both true and both insufficient. What the collection offers instead is something more useful: the discipline of sitting still inside an unfamiliar morning until it becomes, if not yours, then at least a place where you can breathe.

The seven sections move roughly chronologically but are not strictly a memoir. They are more like a ledger — entries made at the same hour across different latitudes, slowly revealing that the accountant has changed more than the hour has. Readers are invited to move through them in order, following the arc from the first borough that shaped a body to the hard-won quiet of a self that can hold multiple cities at once without needing any of them to win. But the poems also survive alone, the way dawn does: complete, brief, indifferent to context, available to anyone willing to be up that early.</div>
