        <div class='book-intro'>Biscayne, Before 1. screen door swings back hard— the aluminum frame still warm from yesterday&#x27;s sun 2. mangrove root splits dark water into two silences— a mullet holds still 3. ibis in the yard one leg lifted, the other sunk in August mud 4. stucco catches fire that particular orange just before the rain 5. the thunderhead builds over Biscayne all afternoon— we keep playing cards 6. underwater, roots make a city no one maps— snook noses through it 7. ibis beak finds what the flooded grass conceals— a patience like stone 8. August presses down on the tin roof of the shed— my brother sleeps through 9. mangrove tangle holds the shoreline together while the Atlantic pulls 10. that orange on walls is not the sun—it is what the sun leaves behind 11. roots below the dock make a handwriting I read face-down in the water 12. the ibis arrives always from the same direction— northeast, after storms 13. screen door memory: the spring that pulled it shut made a sound like a question 14. mud between mangroves holds the shape of what stepped through— heron, not my foot 15. stucco wall at dusk— my grandmother&#x27;s hand flat against the still-warm plaster 16. Biscayne in August smells of diesel and something older than diesel 17. ibis does not look at what it eats—only down, only the long beak 18. roots at low tide show their whole dark architecture— ribs of something huge 19. the screen door&#x27;s metal tasted of salt if you pressed your mouth against it 20. a flooded driveway holds the sky face up—one ibis crosses the whole sky 21. afternoon thunder— my mother counts the seconds, mouthing the numbers 22. mangrove island seen from the causeway—just green, nothing shows beneath 23. August screen door nights we slept with every window failing to help us 24. ibis in a row along the fence post after— after what, I&#x27;d ask 25. stucco holds the heat hours after dark—you can press a cheek to the wall 26. the roots make shadows on the sandy bottom—moving though nothing has moved 27. screen door torn off once in a hurricane—we found it three lots to the south 28. ibis in the flood stands where the sidewalk should be— uncertain of nothing 29. the thunderstorm stalled offshore for an hour—we watched it decide to come 30. underwater roots are darker than the water— a dark inside dark 31. my father&#x27;s white shirt on the porch in August light going briefly gold 32. ibis lifts one wing, settles it back—not flying, just remembering 33. screen door in the rain keeps the sound of rain outside while letting it in 34. mangrove at the edge of the marina—tolerated, not quite belonging 35. stucco crack running from the window to the ground— I measured it yearly 36. the storm&#x27;s first fat drops on the concrete—separate, each one its own sound 37. roots at the surface catch the light like something meant to be seen this way 38. ibis beak withdrawn from the mud—nothing visible but the beak is full Waseda Winter 39. tatami smell— straw and something older, damp— Florida has left me 40. ramen steam rises through the gap in the door frame— my glasses go white 41. the ginkgo drops one then waits—then drops a thousand— I counted nothing 42. chalk on his sleeve cuff white on grey—he never brushed it off all semester 43. ginkgo in January one leaf hangs by a thread of ice— I do not go near 44. his chalk breaks in half mid-stroke—he picks the short piece and continues on 45. the vending light shifts when a cloud crosses the moon— I notice this alone 46. chalk on a cold board— outside the ginkgo releases— I write down the sound 47. vending machine light spills blue across wet asphalt— no one coming home 48. on the cold blackboard his finger traces the stroke he forgot to make 49. the vending machine hums a frequency I feel inside my back teeth 50. noodles in the bowl my reflection stretched across the surface, then gone 51. chalk line beginning a sentence he does not end— the bell has no mercy 52. the lane narrows here between two vending machines— I turn sideways, pass 53. neon and cold rain— the machine&#x27;s reflection swims below my sneakers 54. steam from my ramen someone else&#x27;s from next door— they do not touch, rise 55. tatami at midnight the rain has stopped but the room remembers the sound 56. Takadanobaba— even the syllables fall like ginkgo in groups 57. after the lecture the chalk smell lingers longer than anything said 58. chalk dust still falling— the professor&#x27;s sleeve erases what I almost knew 59. chalk dust in cold air the professor&#x27;s wrist pivots— a kanji appears 60. Takadanobaba— I learn to say the name with my whole body 61. the lit machine waits in the lane between two walls— orange juice, beer, Fanta 62. the lane at two a.m. a cat sits behind the glass studying the light 63. both hands around it the hot can from the machine— Tokyo winter 64. one student coughs in the lecture hall silence— chalk continues 65. the ginkgo&#x27;s bare now I keep walking past to check— still bare, still standing 66. I feed the machine coins still warm from my pocket— the lane stays empty 67. ramen broth cloudy at the bottom, clear on top— I stir it, it clouds 68. tatami breathes cold— somewhere a vending machine sells light to no one 69. midnight in the lane a can of hot coffee waits for anyone&#x27;s hand 70. after the rain stops the tatami holds its shape— the silence does not 71. the vending machine offers me sixteen choices— I stand in the cold 72. tatami squares laid in a logic I learn only after dark 73. a crow on the branch above the vending machine— we both want something The Correspondent 74. press badge face-down— the waiter brings no menu, just another wine 75. Saône before light, a barge&#x27;s wake erasing what I came to write 76. fax unspooling names into the empty office— I don&#x27;t touch the page 77. traboule swallows me mid-sentence, the story bends around a wet wall 78. deadline at seven, the river hasn&#x27;t moved once— I have moved too much 79. grey Lyon at five, the boulangers sliding trays— I file and eat bread 80. press badge laminate, my face younger than my hands, the Saône doesn&#x27;t care 81. the fax machine jams on a photograph of smoke— I clear it, re-send 82. traboule exit opens onto someone&#x27;s grief— I write the address 83. two languages fill the margin of one notebook— the center stays blank 84. café table ring from a glass set down in haste— I circle it twice 85. the correspondent orders the same table— Saône still running 86. dawn press briefing done, I walk the traboule home slow, hearing my own steps 87. fax tone at midnight, the roll of thermal paper scrolling someone&#x27;s war 88. badge clipped to my coat, the gendarme waves me through twice— I forget my name 89. notebook, rain-warped spine, French on top, English beneath— the story between 90. Saône at grey dawn, one fisherman, no fish yet, my deadline the same 91. cold café, Lyon, the press badge earns a corner seat, not warmth, not warmth 92. traboule to traboule, a city that hides its rooms— I find the right door 93. the fax re-dials a number that no longer connects to a place 94. margin note in French: *he would not show his face*— English: *he wept* 95. deadline passed by one hour, the Saône does not file late, the Saône just runs 96. press badge photograph: 1987, Lyon— who was carrying that 97. empty office, two a.m., the fax machine breathing its slow paper breath 98. traboule, Croix-Rousse, silk workers once pressed through here— now a correspondent 99. Lyon rain, slate roofs, the notebook open, soaking— I keep writing anyway 100. badge on the table, I am off the record now, the Saône still on 101. fax paper curling in the tray—a city&#x27;s name I cannot unlearn 102. margin: *Tuesday* margin: *mardi* what happened was real 103. Saône before colour, a barge horn somewhere upstream— the sentence won&#x27;t close 104. café, press badge down, the story printed, running— the coffee gone cold 105. traboule in the rain, someone has chalked a number on the turning wall 106. the fax receiving— I watch the image appear line by slow line, dark 107. Lyon, late October, plane trees dropping their bark strips— I peel my notes back 108. dawn grey over the Saône, a jogger and her dog, once— then only the dog 109. fax machine at rest, the thermal roll nearly spent— I feed it more paper 110. traboule, unmarked door, I have been here and not here— the city permits this 111. two languages fail at the same moment, same line— I leave the space blank 112. Saône, winter light, the bridge stones darker on one side— I work the dark side 113. café, Lyon, noon, the press badge earns a hard look— I order, I stay Form Breaking Form 114. the form breaks the form — underneath, the form remains, watching what I do 115. scissors on newsprint — the headline splits between two facts that were one thing 116. the French draft bleeds through the Japanese underneath — one ghost, two voices 117. thương — not love, not miss — something that aches in the chest without needing cause 118. scissors on newsprint: I am eighty years old and still cutting something 119. the crossed-out French word still visible — *briser* — breaking, below break 120. crossed out — the French rises through the Japanese neither one arrives 121. không gian — this space that is not room, not distance — I circle the word 122. between the question and the answer: a Tuesday, a bowl of bún bò 123. the crossed-out haiku is still a haiku — the X has its own rhythm 124. I draft it in French then cross it out in English — the crossing stays French 125. the haiku refuses its own form, counts its fingers, finds one missing — good 126. saudade — but that is Portuguese — I need the Vietnamese 127. I count the syllables wrong on purpose — the mistake tells me what it means 128. không phải — not that — the negation more precise than what it refuses 129. *bâtir* — I try every English word I own the page stays French 130. scissors at rest on the wooden floor — blades parted like a finished thought 131. newsprint cut to strips — the story continues on the floor, rearranged 132. the margin asks me what I put the poem there to avoid saying 133. *ma* — the Japanese pause that lives inside a room — Hanoi has no word 134. a word with no twin in the other language sits in the poem alone 135. the French draft, crossed out, is more honest than the one I let you read here 136. the haiku argues with the page about the page — the page does not blink 137. the scissors open on the wooden floor — the light cuts the room in two 138. the margin is not empty — it is listening in its own language 139. the question mark curves back toward itself — it has doubts about its own doubt 140. the wooden floor holds the scissors, the newsprint, the afternoon&#x27;s failure 141. white margin at dusk: the Hanoi street noise rises, the margin holds still Hoan Kiem at Eighty 142. she counts in Vietnamese, her breath a white flag— I count with my hands 143. the turtle&#x27;s return measured not in months but in what the water keeps 144. pho broth before dawn— the whole street leans one direction toward that open door 145. xe om driver folded over handlebars— his helmet, a moon 146. I do not hurry to the lake—the lake is still practicing its lake 147. the woman in blue stretches both arms toward the east— the east doesn&#x27;t move 148. star anise in broth— I have lived long enough now to smell what time wants 149. the turtle surfaces once—which is enough— then the water closes 150. peeling yellow wall: what stays is not the color but what&#x27;s underneath 151. five o&#x27;clock bodies moving in unison—I join the middle row 152. no one leads the group and yet the arms all rise— some knowledge is old 153. he sleeps on his bike one foot still touching the ground— a practiced letting go 154. the lake in August smells of mud and old iron— Miami, briefly 155. bougainvillea thorn— I find it after the fact, a small red comma 156. the broth has been simmering since before I woke— someone else&#x27;s night 157. my knees on the path— the doctor said what doctors say— the herons don&#x27;t care 158. a turtle&#x27;s one breath taken at the surface—then the whole year, below 159. the xe om driver dreams of somewhere—his hands loose— the throttle, untouched 160. yellow wall, morning light— what the French called *patine*— I call it staying 161. the group disperses at six—the park empties—grass remembers their feet 162. pho window, open— I have stood in Lyon rain wanting something warm 163. the lake is not old— the lake is the same age as whatever looks in 164. the turtle was here when the French were here—the wall was yellow then too 165. I write in English, think in French, dream in a tongue Hanoi hasn&#x27;t named 166. bougainvillea— in Miami we called it ordinary 167. the xe om driver wakes when a moto passes— then sleeps again, exact 168. broth through a window: the cook has been standing there longer than the dark 169. my eightieth year— the turtle has had many— we nod, in a way 170. the park at five a.m.— no one asks anyone&#x27;s name— the body is enough 171. he sleeps with one eye not quite closed—the xe om way— half-in, half-watching 172. the lake doesn&#x27;t care that I have stood at three rivers— still, it lets me look 173. morning aerobics— the woman in the red hat has been here for years 174. pho before sunrise— the bowl arrives and I hold both hands around it 175. the turtle&#x27;s one breath— I used to photograph things— now I just watch them 176. bougainvillea— the color has no business being so certain 177. five a.m., the park— a man with a badminton racket, no one to play with 178. yellow wall, a gecko— still as a brushstroke— then not there at all 179. the broth has cardamom, has ginger, has a night I wasn&#x27;t there for 180. the turtle surfaces— I have heard this from neighbors— the lake agrees, quietly 181. I move my arms up with the group—at eighty, up is a direction 182. my French wife would say *laisse faire*—the lake says nothing— both are right by now 183. the xe om driver and I have an understanding: I walk; he sleeps What Carries 184. the egret lifts white— I reach for a word: flamingo— wrong bird, right longing 185. pink ghost on the wing above Hoan Kiem&#x27;s still water— Biscayne answers back 186. what the egret knows: to stand in water and wait Miami taught this 187. flamingo I saw once through chain-link at the zoo— the egret forgives 188. both birds fish alone one memory, one morning— the lake holds them both 189. French cursive loops through a Vietnamese notebook page— two hands, one letter 190. the accent grave slopes the same direction as loss— I write both nations 191. my pen learned Lyon but the paper here is thin— different absorbency 192. in the margin, oui written where a word broke loose— Hanoi doesn&#x27;t mind 193. she sold me this book at the Đồng Xuân market stall— inside: my old life 194. Lyon rain was grey and fell on grey stone truly— a committed rain 195. Tokyo rain fell like something being decided— precise, conclusive 196. Miami rain came screaming from a clear blue sky— no patience for clouds 197. Hanoi rain arrives as though it has always been— no beginning found 198. four cities, one cloud moving through me all at once— I stand in the street 199. the gutter carries whatever each city left— all of it, seaward 200. not the same sweetness— closer to almost-the-same— which is its own thing 201. I ate mango once on NW 2nd Avenue— I was nine years old 202. my mother&#x27;s kitchen the knife, the rind, the slow juice— this one echoes it 203. the fiber catches between the same teeth, older— Miami loosens 204. almost is enough when you are eighty and far— the mango agrees 205. one fruit, two cities— neither one entirely real— the taste is the proof 206. mono no aware— I used it on a Tuesday watching the egret 207. no English for it— the French come close with douceur— Vietnamese: chờ 208. each language offers a different shape of the same ache in the ribcage 209. in Japanese class we learned it as a concept— now it is my life 210. the professor&#x27;s voice from Waseda, 1968— I hear it in rain 211. aware: the egret lifting before you are ready— the flamingo: gone 212. to name the longing does not make it smaller— it makes it precise 213. I write it in four alphabets and it remains exactly itself 214. what carries across: the angle of afternoon light is never the same 215. what carries across: the habit of watching doors for what might enter 216. what carries across: ordering coffee alone and being alright 217. what carries across: the notebook opened to write before knowing what 218. what carries across: the way a city smells just before the rain starts Late Dispatches 219. I leave the letter mid-sentence, go make tea, come back to the comma 220. delta of the wrist— where the pulse fans out and slows into its own mud 221. the first page stays blank the way a door left open stays a kind of yes 222. Red River at last light— neither arriving nor leaving— I pull up a chair 223. Red River turning the color of old copper— I don&#x27;t close the blind 224. blank first page—the pen rests in the groove between days neither in nor out 225. she laughs at something I couldn&#x27;t catch—I laugh too, holding the phone warm 226. grandchild&#x27;s voice drops out— the silence that follows is not empty, just far 227. the letter begins with your name, then a long breath— the rest can come slow 228. water hyacinth drifting past—not lost, I think, just without a plan 229. she asks where I am— I say home, and mean it, and wait for the word to land 230. between two sentences a pause long enough to hear a motorbike pass 231. she says she misses me in the voice she uses for things she means exactly 232. the window stays open— whatever comes through it now I have room for 233. her voice recedes to static then back—I hold on through the in-between 234. the unfinished letter knows what it wants to say— I am catching up 235. the current carries a plastic bag and a leaf with the same patience 236. the pen rests crosswise on the letter&#x27;s open mouth— morning can close it 237. the phone warm in my palm— after she hangs up, I hold it a little longer 238. the letter will end when it knows how—I am not its deadline anymore 239. the window holds dusk the way a hand holds water— briefly, and then not 240. her voice through the phone says grandpa twice before I find the right button 241. I pick up the pen and set it down—the blank page accepts both gestures 242. late afternoon light crosses the desk the long way— I let it do that 243. one egret standing in the shallows—I have stopped needing to name this 244. the pen has dried out— I find another, sit back down, the comma still there 245. Red River, Red River— even the name is something I say without rush 246. the blank page at dawn is not a failure—it is the first weather of the day 247. dusk thickens the room— I leave the lamp off a while longer than I planned 248. the river flattens where it meets itself again— I recognize this 249. the body&#x27;s delta— silt settling where the water finally lets go 250. the first page, still white— outside, a cloud crosses the sun and crosses back again</div>
