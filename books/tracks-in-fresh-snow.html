        <div class='book-intro'># Welcome to Sixty-Three Moments Welcome to this collection of haiku—sixty-three brief encounters with the natural world and the quiet moments that shape our days. Like dewdrops catching morning light or the last leaf clinging to an autumn branch, each poem here captures a single instant, inviting you to pause and see the world with fresh eyes. Haiku, the beloved Japanese poetic form, distills experience into its essence. Traditionally composed of seventeen syllables arranged in three lines (5-7-5), haiku seeks to present a moment of awareness—often featuring nature, the seasons, or sudden insights that arise from careful observation. The best haiku work like pebbles dropped into still water, creating ripples of meaning that extend far beyond their brief lines. This collection honors both the classical spirit of haiku and its evolution in contemporary poetry. You&#x27;ll find poems that follow traditional patterns alongside others that embrace a more flexible approach to syllable count while maintaining haiku&#x27;s essential quality: the ability to stop time and illuminate the extraordinary within the ordinary. The sixty-three haiku gathered here unfold through the seasons, beginning with spring&#x27;s tentative awakening and cycling through summer&#x27;s abundance, autumn&#x27;s transformation, and winter&#x27;s contemplative stillness. This seasonal organization reflects haiku&#x27;s deep connection to the natural world and the Japanese concept of *mono no aware*—the bittersweet awareness of the impermanence of all things. These poems emerged through an AI-assisted creative process, where technology and human sensibility collaborated to craft moments of beauty and insight. Each haiku was carefully curated to ensure it carried that spark of recognition—the &quot;ah!&quot; moment that makes a haiku memorable. How to read these haiku? There&#x27;s no single right way. You might read straight through, letting the seasonal progression wash over you like a year in miniature. Or open randomly and let chance guide you to the poem you need in this moment. Some readers prefer to linger with each haiku, reading it multiple times to uncover layers of meaning. Others enjoy the gentle rhythm of moving from one brief image to the next. Consider reading them aloud—haiku&#x27;s music often emerges more fully when spoken. Notice how each poem creates a small world complete in itself, yet connects to the larger themes of change, beauty, and our place within the natural order. Whether you&#x27;re new to haiku or a longtime lover of the form, may these sixty-three moments offer you islands of calm in busy days and fresh ways of seeing the world that surrounds us all. *—Andrea Bruno* As summer&#x27;s warmth fades into memory, autumn arrives with its own quiet drama—a season of transformation painted in amber light and shadow. This collection captures the profound shifts that mark fall&#x27;s passage, where nature prepares for winter&#x27;s rest through rituals both ancient and eternal. The crows that populate these verses serve as autumn&#x27;s most compelling messengers. These intelligent, social birds become harbingers of seasonal change, their dark forms stark against October&#x27;s muted palette. Watch them gather in parliament on bare branches, their calls echoing across fields where summer&#x27;s abundance now lies scattered on the ground. In their communal feasting and watchful presence, we witness nature&#x27;s wisdom—the instinctive preparation for leaner times ahead. These haiku invite us to pause and observe autumn&#x27;s subtle theater: the way evening light filters differently through thinning leaves, how creatures great and small respond to shortening days, and the bittersweet beauty found in endings that promise new beginnings. Here, in seventeen syllables, the season&#x27;s essence unfolds.</div>
