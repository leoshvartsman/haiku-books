        <div class='book-intro'># Introduction Welcome to this collection of 250 haiku—a journey through the seasons that celebrates both the ancient wisdom of this beloved Japanese poetic form and the fresh possibilities that emerge when tradition meets innovation. Haiku, with its deceptively simple structure of three lines, has captivated poets and readers for centuries. Traditionally following a 5-7-5 syllable pattern, these brief poems originated in 17th-century Japan as a way to capture fleeting moments in nature and human experience. The greatest haiku masters like Bashō, Buson, and Issa understood that within these few syllables lay the power to distill entire worlds—a dewdrop reflecting dawn, the sound of a frog jumping into water, the first cherry blossom of spring. This anthology embraces both classical and contemporary approaches to haiku. You&#x27;ll find poems that honor traditional seasonal references (kigo) and cutting words (kireji), alongside others that stretch the form in new directions while maintaining haiku&#x27;s essential spirit: the art of noticing, of finding profound beauty in small moments, of connecting human emotion to the natural world. These haiku were born from a unique collaboration between human sensibility and artificial intelligence—a modern twist on an ancient form. Each poem was carefully curated for its ability to evoke that special quality the Japanese call &quot;mono no aware&quot;—the bittersweet awareness of the impermanence of all things. The collection follows the traditional seasonal progression: Spring&#x27;s renewal and hope, Summer&#x27;s abundance and intensity, Autumn&#x27;s transformation and reflection, and Winter&#x27;s stillness and introspection. This organization invites you to move through the year&#x27;s emotional landscape, experiencing how each season carries its own moods, colors, and revelations. There are many ways to engage with this collection. You might read it straight through like a meditation on the passage of time, or open randomly to discover what moment calls to you today. Some readers prefer to align their reading with the actual seasons, while others enjoy the contrast of reading winter poems on a summer afternoon. Each haiku stands alone, yet they also speak to one another across the pages. Take your time with these poems. Let them breathe. A haiku is not meant to be consumed quickly but savored—like watching clouds change shape or listening to rain on leaves. Notice what images arise in your mind, what emotions surface, what memories stir. In our fast-paced world, haiku offers something precious: permission to pause, to notice, to find wonder in the everyday. May these small poems open large spaces in your heart and mind, connecting you more deeply to the beautiful, fleeting world we all share. Spring arrives not as a single moment but as a gradual awakening—tender shoots pushing through sidewalk cracks, the first warm evening that invites us to linger outdoors, the mingling of exhaust and jasmine that marks a city coming back to life. This season of renewal reveals itself in both grand gestures and quiet intimacies: a grandmother&#x27;s patient hands transforming winter&#x27;s stored bounty into spring&#x27;s fresh promise, vendors threading fragrant blossoms through bustling streets. These haiku capture spring&#x27;s essential duality—the ancient rhythms of growth and the modern world that surrounds them. Here, diesel fumes don&#x27;t diminish jasmine&#x27;s perfume but create something entirely new, a contemporary pastoral that acknowledges how beauty persists and adapts. Whether found in a family ritual on a front stoop or in the unexpected poetry of a traffic intersection, spring emerges as both timeless and immediate, reminding us that rebirth happens everywhere, even in the most unlikely places. Each poem invites us to pause and notice the small resurrections occurring all around us.</div>
