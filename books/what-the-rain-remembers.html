        <div class='book-intro'>Water does not remember where it has been — and yet it carries everything. Sediment, salt, the shape of the vessel it once filled. River Lewis&#x27;s debut collection takes its title from this paradox: the rain that falls on you in one city is not the same rain that finds you in another, and yet something accumulates. Over two decades and three cities — Portland, Melbourne, Dhaka — these haiku trace the slow geology of a life lived at close range with beauty, bureaucracy, displacement, and the daily negotiations of belonging to more than one world at once. They do not explain. They witness.

The haiku form is itself a kind of palimpsest — ancient, borrowed, endlessly reinhabited. Lewis works within its constraints the way water works within a riverbank: not fighting the edges, but finding, over time, what the edges will yield. The poems move through fog and monsoon, through workshop margins and government waiting rooms, through the specific grief of watching someone else&#x27;s loss and knowing your language for it is still imperfect. They accumulate the way a person accumulates: not in a straight line, but in layers, each place pressing its particular grey or gold or wet into whoever you were before you arrived.

This is not a collection about resolution. There is no clean homecoming, no final fluency, no moment at which the sky of one city stops ghosting the sky of another. What there is instead is attention — patient, unflinching, sometimes overwhelmed, always returning. Lewis asks us to stay in the low places where water gathers, and to look carefully at what it has carried there.</div>
