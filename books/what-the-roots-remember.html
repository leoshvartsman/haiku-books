        <div class='book-intro'>Casey García has spent a career learning the names of plants — their Latin binomials, their cellular architectures, the precise vocabulary of leaf margins and root systems. This collection asks what happens when that same patient, exacting attention is turned inward, toward the self as specimen: rooted, transplanted, pressed flat, revived. What the Roots Remember traces a life across four cities and five decades, not as memoir but as accumulation — the way a herbarium accumulates, one carefully mounted sheet at a time, until the whole becomes an argument about time and survival that no single specimen could make alone.

Haiku, with its insistence on the present moment and its ruthless economy, turns out to be the ideal form for a scientist&#x27;s autobiography. Both disciplines require you to look before you conclude. Both distrust ornament. Both understand that a single well-chosen detail — the temperature of a gourd, the angle of afternoon light on a specimen tray, the shape of coffee trembling in a plastic cup at thirty thousand feet — can hold more truth than a paragraph of explanation. García does not explain her longing or her grief or her hard-won stillness. She shows you what her hands were doing at the time.

The seven sections of this book move roughly chronologically through landscape and life, but the book&#x27;s deeper movement is something more like geology than biography: layers pressing down on layers, heat and pressure transforming what was once soft into something that holds its shape. Readers who have ever left a place they did not choose to leave, or arrived somewhere that did not yet know their name, will find their own sediment here. The roots remember. The body keeps the record. What García offers, in two hundred and fifty haiku, is the record itself.</div>
