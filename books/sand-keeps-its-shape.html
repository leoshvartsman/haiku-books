        <div class='book-intro'>There is a particular kind of attention that belongs to people who have learned to read more than one world. It notices the mud at the river&#x27;s edge and the heron&#x27;s patience within it. It catches the scent of cardamom in a hotel lobby and understands, before the mind can explain, what that scent is asking to be remembered. The 250 haiku gathered here were written in that mode of attention — one that moves between landscapes, languages, and the small ceremonies of daily life, looking for the moments when the visible world briefly shows us its underside.

*Sand Keeps Its Shape* moves across geographies both literal and interior: the Nile&#x27;s banks and November snowfall, boardroom windows and library carrels, the Arabic letter that resists translation and the passport booth where identity becomes a matter of selection. What ties these poems together is not a single place or a single life, but a sensibility — one shaped by the experience of belonging partially to several worlds and fully to none, of carrying languages that do not always speak to each other, of finding that the self, like sand, holds a form even as everything around it shifts. These are poems of threshold and transit, of breathing in before the numbers come up on the screen.

The haiku form suits this sensibility well. Its compression demands that the poet choose — one image, one turn, one breath — and that act of choosing, as several poems here quietly acknowledge, is never innocent. To write in this form is to practice a kind of discipline that feels familiar to anyone who has learned to move between registers of belonging. The pigeons preen anyway. The Gulf does not age. The heron holds still in the mud. It is the poet&#x27;s hope that in reading these small, precise moments, something in the reader will also hold still — long enough to feel the heat rising through the iron grate, to press a palm to cold glass, to count the seconds.</div>
