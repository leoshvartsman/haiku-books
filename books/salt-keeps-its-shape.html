        <div class='book-intro'>These poems began, most of them, in the middle of something else — a corridor walked too fast, a table steadied by hand, a fig no one thought to pick. They are not poems of arrival or conclusion. They are poems of the threshold moment, the hairline fracture, the thing that leaks through before you can stop it. The title comes from a quality I kept noticing in the material world: how certain substances hold their form even as they dissolve, how salt on stone maintains its outline long after the water has gone. The cracked azulejo tiles of Lisbon, the frost on a harbor window, the red crease a stethoscope leaves on skin — these are the kinds of marks the collection follows, the evidence that something passed through and did not leave cleanly.

The 250 haiku gathered here move across landscapes and years without announcing the transitions. A New Zealand pohutukawa drops its petals on a windowsill in one poem; a man murmurs something to himself in a crowded subway car in the next. I have not tried to smooth the distances between them. What connects these poems is not geography or chronology but a shared quality of attention — the willingness to stay with a moment just past its obvious meaning, to let the stone be a stone and still feel what it refuses to give back. The sea appears often, usually at the edge of the frame, usually withholding something. So do faces, thresholds, and the small negotiations we make to keep ordinary things upright.

If there is a sensibility threading through this work, it is one that trusts the partial and the unresolved. The painter&#x27;s glaze cracks and what was meant to be contained leaks into the light — this is not presented as loss, exactly, though it is not presented as gift either. It simply is what happens. These poems ask you to stand with them in that in-between place, where the crack runs from the saint to the sea and your thumb, almost without thinking, finds the gap.</div>
