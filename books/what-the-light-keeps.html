        <div class='book-intro'>A life is not a continuous thing. It is a series of weathers, of crossings, of rooms entered and left — and what we carry forward is less a narrative than a residue: the particular slant of light through a particular window, the weight of a word in a language not quite your own, the way ruin can bloom. Robin Hughes was born in postwar London, worked for decades in international trade, and came in her seventies to Stockholm, where she began writing haiku in earnest. What the Light Keeps is the record of that long arc, though record is too linear a word for what haiku does. These poems do not tell a life so much as locate it — in weather, in thresholds, in the compressed moment that holds more than it should.

The haiku form suited Hughes, she has said, because it demands the same thing that long living demands: that you choose what matters, and let the rest go white. There are 250 poems in this collection, arranged in seven sections that move roughly — but not rigidly — through time: from bomb-site London to a transatlantic career, through a marriage and its dissolution, to the archipelago winters of a life remade. Readers will find no confessional explanation here, no connective tissue of prose memoir. What they will find is something more precise and, in its precision, more open: the image that carries the feeling without naming it, the line break that is also a held breath.

The sections have been given titles, but they are not chapters. They are more like weather systems — each with its own pressure, its own quality of light — and they overlap at the edges, as weather does. A reader may move through them in order or by instinct. Either way, the light at the end is the same light that appears at the beginning, only now you have learned, as Hughes has, what it keeps.</div>
