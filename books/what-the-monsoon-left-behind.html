        <div class='book-intro'>Weather is not neutral. It arrives with history — the typhoon that knows your grandmother&#x27;s roof, the frost that has never heard your name before, the monsoon that follows you into memory long after you have left its reach. In What the Monsoon Left Behind, Casey Santos moves through seven decades and four countries not as a traveler collecting impressions but as a body accumulating weather, learning the specific grammar of each place and the cost of translation. These poems are the residue of that accumulation: what soaks in, what evaporates, what leaves a watermark on the skin.

The haiku here do not behave like souvenirs. They do not prettify displacement or resolve its contradictions into tidy epiphany. Santos works instead in the form&#x27;s native tension — the cut, the juxtaposition, the syllable held just long enough to ache — to render a life that is genuinely plural without being weightless. To be from Tondo and Blue Ridge and Dhaka and the quiet hills above Wellington is not to be from everywhere in some celebratory sense. It is to carry specific muds on specific shoes, to know several kinds of silence, to answer to a name that opens differently depending on who is saying it.

Read these poems slowly, and in order if you can. The book has a body, and the body has a direction: from the saturated heat of origin toward something that is not quite arrival but is, perhaps, a kind of earned stillness. What the monsoon left behind is not ruin. It is the shape of what was strong enough to remain.</div>
