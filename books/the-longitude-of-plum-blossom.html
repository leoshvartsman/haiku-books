        <div class='book-intro'>In classical haiku, the kigo — the seasonal reference word — is not decoration. It is an anchor. It tells the reader where in the year they stand, and by extension, where in the world. Nao Sato spent five decades testing that anchor against four cities on three continents, and what she found is the subject of this book: that the anchor does not hold, and that this is not a failure. It is, instead, the beginning of a different kind of attention.

Sato trained as an environmental researcher, a woman whose professional life was organized around measurement — humidity, particulate matter, seasonal drift, the gap between what instruments record and what actually happens in the air. The haiku collected here were written across that same career, in notebooks that also held field data, immigration forms, grocery lists in three languages, and the occasional pressed flower logged with the same precision as everything else. They were not written for publication. They were written, it seems, because the body kept noticing things that the data could not hold.

The Longitude of Plum Blossom moves through seven sections, each corresponding to a different latitude of belonging — Tokyo, an unnamed northern European city, Mexico City, a period of transit and reckoning, Buenos Aires, and finally the interior country that has no coordinates at all. Readers familiar with haiku will find the traditional architecture here — the cut, the season, the single luminous instant — but they will also find it quietly pressured, asked to accommodate a life that refuses to stay in one hemisphere. What emerges is not a dismantling of the form but a deepening of it: a record of what it means to carry a season inside you long after the calendar has moved on.</div>
