        <div class='book-intro'>Sky Singh has spent eight decades moving between cities and languages, between columns of figures and the silences that columns cannot hold. This collection is the record of that movement — not a memoir, not a confession, but something closer to what remains after memory has done its quiet work: the flour-dusted wrist caught in morning light, the smell of cedar in a drawer you cannot place, the bead worn smooth by forty-seven years of the same prayer. Haiku, with its insistence on the present moment, might seem an unlikely form for a life so distributed across time and geography. But Singh finds in its compression precisely the right instrument — a form that does not explain, does not mourn too loudly, does not resolve what refuses to be resolved. The title borrows its terms from accounting, the profession that anchored Singh&#x27;s working life across continents. A ledger is a book of final entries, a place where every transaction is eventually settled. But Singh&#x27;s ledger refuses to close. Prague surfaces between sleep and a ceiling fan. Baltimore dogwood petals fall into notebooks carried to Portland. A grandmother&#x27;s wrist holds its light across seven decades and ten thousand miles. Between Ledgers and Light moves backward and forward through time without apology, trusting the reader to find their footing in the fog — because the fog, Singh suggests, is where the most honest seeing happens. The spirit, this book quietly insists, keeps no final accounts. It simply continues, season by season, city by city, one bead at a time.</div>
