        <div class='book-intro'>A life measured in soils—the black loam of Canadian prairies, the red clay of South African townships, the highland earth of Ethiopia where eucalyptus roots run deep. These haiku trace a geography of belonging that cannot be contained by any single border or name. They follow the path of hands that have pulled grain from frozen ground and steadied teacups in mountain air, of a heart that has learned to call multiple landscapes home. From the grain elevators of small-town Canada to the jacaranda-lined streets of Addis Ababa, &#x27;Four Soils, One Sky&#x27; maps the internal territories we carry within us—the way morning light in one country can suddenly recall the scent of snow in another, how the body holds memory in its palms long after we&#x27;ve crossed continents. These are poems of migration and settlement, of names that change and roots that deepen, of the quiet revelation that home is not a place but a practice of attention to the world&#x27;s endless offerings.</div>
