        <div class='book-intro'>Buriganga 1. jackfruit split on stone, yellow fingers of the heat reaching into me 2. mother&#x27;s radio through the ceiling fan&#x27;s wobble— a singer, then blades 3. minaret upside down in the puddle—god floats there, patient as a carp 4. the Buriganga does not smell of water— it smells of itself 5. diesel smoke, then fish, then something burning upstream— I breathe all of it 6. before the bell rings the rickshaw-wallah clears his throat— city, beginning 7. monsoon puddle wide as a courtyard—a child tests its edge with one toe 8. jackfruit&#x27;s white latex on my wrist all afternoon— the heat sets it there 9. fan blade, fan blade, fan blade— between each one, a word from the radio 10. the ferry leans right, everyone leans right with it— this is how we trust 11. smoke from the engine writes something in Bengali above the brown wake 12. at dawn the minarets are the same color as fog— you have to believe 13. puddle holds the sky for three minutes after rain— then a sandal breaks it 14. splitting jackfruit: first that thick green crack, then the smell hits you like a door 15. mother turns the dial— static, singer, static, rain— she leaves it on rain 16. ferry smoke at dusk goes pink before it goes dark— the river ignores this 17. radio static is also a kind of song mother hums along to 18. four a.m., the bells— not music yet, not alarm— something in between 19. I watch the ferry from the bank until the smoke is all that is left 20. puddle-minaret ripples when a bus passes— god, briefly, shaking 21. the river is brown the way skin is brown—not one brown, but all of them 22. jackfruit on the cart, the vendor&#x27;s hand on his knife— he waits for my eyes 23. ceiling fan at noon stirs the heat into the heat— a useless kindness 24. mother&#x27;s radio: a woman singing of rain while it actually rains 25. rickshaw bell—a dog lifts its head, decides no, puts it back down slow 26. smoke on the water is not the same as mist— smoke has a history 27. monsoon puddle full of a whole minaret—then one drop more, and gone 28. fan wobble, fan wobble— the light on the wall moves like water, not like light 29. the bell before dawn is the city asking itself: still here? still here? yes. 30. ferry smoke climbing— a crow flies through it and comes out the same crow, darker 31. I know the river the bend just confirms 32. puddle at the gate: a whole pink sky, my sandal, then just my sandal 33. mother hums along to a song she doesn&#x27;t like— habit is its own love 34. jackfruit split open: something that was private now just is the world 35. ceiling fan&#x27;s one squeak every third rotation— I still hear it now 36. rickshaw bell at dawn, then another, then the birds decide to join in 37. minaret at dawn, its reflection in the puddle— which one calls to us 38. jackfruit smell carries three streets before the cart does— the city knows first 39. fan blade catching light— four times a second I see the room, then I don&#x27;t 40. smoke from the engine, smoke from the tea stall, smoke from someone&#x27;s morning breath— 41. rickshaw bell: a child stops mid-run, one foot still up, listening, then runs 42. the river at dawn is not beautiful—it is simply enormous 43. jackfruit latex dries to a white ring on my palm— I wear it to school 44. mother&#x27;s radio left on through the afternoon— the singer outlasts her nap 45. puddle-sky shattered reforms behind it The Body Learns Altitude 46. first snow in Boulder— I mistake the silence for something I broke 47. cottonwood June storm— white seeds press against my screen like unanswered mail 48. the seminar ends no one moves their coffee cup thin air holds us still 49. magpies on the fence— their blue-black the same color as my landlord&#x27;s door 50. rented mattress springs— I learn where the valley dips 51. Rocky Mountain dawn— the light comes from too far left I keep turning east 52. cottonwood seeds drift into my open notebook— I let them stay there 53. seminar table— someone&#x27;s pencil taps a beat we all hold our breath 54. altitude headache— I read the same line three times then close the window 55. magpie lands, tilts head— considers my lunch, decides I&#x27;m not worth the risk 56. the snowmelt runs cold through the gutter at my feet— I came here for this 57. five weeks in Boulder I still set my alarm for a city twelve hours gone 58. seminar silence— my professor&#x27;s pen uncaps the whole room shifts weight 59. magpies at the lot argue over something flat I cross to my car 60. thin air, rented room— I hang one photograph: just the nail, no photo 61. snowmelt on the path moves faster than I expect— I step back, watch it 62. the Flatirons at dusk turn the color of the bricks on Mirpur Road, almost 63. cottonwood seeds— I breathe one in, cough twice, laugh alone in the lot 64. seminar table— the gap between two speakers where I could have gone 65. magpie on fence post preens one wing, then the other— unhurried Tuesday 66. altitude: I pour water, drink it, pour again— the body asks twice 67. rented mattress, 2 a.m.— outside, a sprinkler starts up ticking like a clock 68. June in Boulder— the mountains don&#x27;t care that I&#x27;m here, good 69. cottonwood summer I learn the word for this drift: fluff, fuzz, snow-not-snow 70. seminar: someone quotes a poet I don&#x27;t know— I write the name down 71. snowmelt creek behind the campus library— I eat lunch there, once 72. magpies leave the fence all at once, no signal I could see from the door 73. the rented kitchen— I boil rice the way my mother showed me, wrong pan 74. thin air and a cough that won&#x27;t leave all October— my body protests 75. cottonwood fluff caught in the screen door&#x27;s black mesh frame— I don&#x27;t clean it out 76. seminar table— my notebook open, nothing written, grade: present 77. altitude teaches the lungs a slower grammar— I conjugate: stay 78. Rocky Mountain dark— no river sound, no ferry horn— the quiet is loud 79. magpie on the fence holds something silver—doesn&#x27;t fly, just stands with it 80. snowmelt in April turns the campus paths to glass— I fall, no one sees 81. rented mattress: I press my ear to the pillow— hear my own heartbeat 82. cottonwood June white— I walk through it like weather I haven&#x27;t named yet 83. seminar table— the window behind my chair frames only blue sky Red Light, Prenzlauer Berg 84. U-Bahn doors close on my coat sleeve — the city keeps what it wants of me 85. November linden bare as a proof after cuts — what remains holds 86. döner wrapper turns in the gutter&#x27;s slow current — no one watching it 87. a stranger lights up in the courtyard — I pretend the smoke is for me 88. galley paper warm from the press — I mark the flaw no reader will find 89. U-Bahn doors open to no one I know — still I straighten my jacket 90. the linden&#x27;s last leaf holds past midnight — I count it among the living 91. proof mark in red ink: stet — let it stand — the city says this to no one 92. döner grease darkens the paper as it travels — Tuesday&#x27;s appetite 93. courtyard cigarette half-finished on the sill — whose longing, abandoned 94. platform at Eberswalder — the doors close, the map stays lit behind glass 95. November cough of a stranger — we do not meet each other&#x27;s eyes, good 96. the galley: one line orphaned at the top — I know what it is to start 97. linden bark holds rain long after the rain has stopped — the wood, remembering 98. U-Bahn window gives me back my own face, moving through the tunnel dark 99. a red light holds at Kastanienallee — taxis, nobody in them 100. döner wrapper snagged on a drain cover, flapping — the city&#x27;s small flag 101. I delete a word from the galley — silence where something used to be 102. the stranger&#x27;s ember arcs down into the courtyard — a comet, local 103. linden in November: each branch an editor&#x27;s line through what was green 104. U-Bahn seat still warm from whoever left before — I inherit this 105. the proof mark means: wrong — but I keep rereading it to be sure, to be sure 106. Prenzlauer Berg, 11 p.m. — the kebab shop&#x27;s grease lamp yellowing the fog 107. courtyard: one window lit, one dark — I live between these two conclusions 108. döner wrapper lifts, settles, lifts — the wind can&#x27;t choose either, same as me 109. a smudge of red ink on my thumb — I&#x27;ve been marking what does not belong 110. U-Bahn: the doors breathe open, closed — the platform empties into the cold street 111. November linden casts no shadow under grey — the sky refuses 112. galley line by line — I find the error at last: a word spelled like grief 113. the stranger hums low in the courtyard — not a song, just proof of a mouth 114. döner wrapper: sesame seed still stuck to the grease — the meal&#x27;s last syllable 115. U-Bahn map above the door — I trace the line home with one finger, slow 116. proof marks accumulate: delete, transpose, close space — the page learns to shrink 117. in the courtyard snow not yet — just the smell of it — the stranger flicks ash 118. galley in my bag all the way home on the U-Bahn — error, riding with me 119. red light on the wet cobblestone — the whole street bleeds quietly, briefly 120. linden tree at Senefelderplatz: I stop beneath it to feel less alone 121. döner wrapper caught against the building&#x27;s base — the wind forgot it was there 122. U-Bahn: two people kissing — the doors close on that too, like everything 123. November, Berlin — the sky the color of a proof before any marks 124. I press stet in red beside the cut line — let it stand — let it stand there 125. the stranger&#x27;s last drag — then the courtyard goes quiet in a specific way Syncopation 126. the bass note stretches— a riksdag bell fades into what the note becomes 127. between two edits the cursor blinks like a pulse no one is counting 128. E-flat left hanging— the trumpet player walks off, the room keeps listening 129. I mark a comma, remove it, mark it again— the paragraph breathes 130. chord without a root: snow on Södermalm at dusk, the tram still coming 131. the set ends, someone drops a glass in the kitchen— the silence adjusts 132. a bass string still moves after the bow lifts away— my hand, still holding 133. galley proof at noon: one word crossed out in blue ink, the white around it 134. he plays the same four bars until the bar becomes a different question 135. the space before yes— I have lived there, unharvested, longer than I meant 136. ink dries on the word I replaced with a better word I now doubt 137. the upright bass leans against the wall after the set— wood remembering 138. revision six: the paragraph I cut returns, thinner, more honest 139. a chord that won&#x27;t land— the pianist&#x27;s left hand waits for the right to choose 140. between two cymbal strikes, a tram on Hornsgatan— both rhythms, correct 141. the session tape loops: one measure of silence where the drummer breathed in 142. I hold the blue pen above the line—not striking, not yet forgiving 143. the horn player&#x27;s cheeks deflate before the next phrase— the note in that gap 144. a proof mark: delete. the deleted word still shapes the sentence around it 145. unresolved fifth— my neighbour&#x27;s television through the winter wall 146. the reel turns, catches, the splice a white flash between two versions of truth 147. holding the bass note: the melody forgets where it was supposed to go 148. the set list, revised in pencil on a beer mat— three songs crossed out twice 149. after the last bar, the audience remembers how to move their hands 150. ink not yet dry: I breathe across the page, the word blurs at one edge only 151. the trumpet waits out sixteen bars, then enters wrong— perfectly wrong 152. the space between takes: someone refills a water glass, the mics still open 153. a suspended chord— outside, a gull turns over the grey Mälaren 154. the editor&#x27;s mark asks a question the author will answer by dawn 155. three beats of silence after the bass solo ends: the room reconsidering Archipelago Grammar 156. the ferry cuts through grey water — my wake spreads wide then closes behind 157. March ice along the dock — I tap it with my boot it holds, then it doesn&#x27;t 158. birch bark peeling back in the low four o&#x27;clock sun — something white inside 159. Swedish vowel caught between my teeth like a seed — I swallow it whole 160. the archipelago has forty thousand islands I have learned three words 161. Baltic light in March: not cold exactly — the word I want doesn&#x27;t come 162. ferry horn at dusk the water holds the sound long after the boat&#x27;s gone 163. I mispronounce *sjö* the shopkeeper smiles gently — the lake doesn&#x27;t care 164. birch in low winter light — even the shadows here lean a different way 165. December: darkness falls at four, the city folds its hands and waits 166. ice shelf at the edge of the dock — not thick enough to walk on, not thin 167. the ferry wake spreads into grey — I watch it lose its shape, then watch more 168. a Swedish syllable I&#x27;ve been practicing wrong for three weeks now 169. the Baltic in March holds the cold the way a held breath holds — not breathing 170. four o&#x27;clock: the sky pulls a curtain no one asked for over the whole day 171. ice cracks at the shore not breaking, just adjusting — I know this feeling 172. I write my address in Swedish on an envelope in my Bengali hand 173. low winter birch light — I have no word for this yet in any language 174. the grey water takes the wake and smooths it over — the ferry forgets 175. December 4pm: the lamps come on in windows I am outside them 176. one Swedish phrase I know perfectly: *förlåt mig* — forgive me, forgive me 177. birch bark curls away from itself — what is underneath is also birch bark 178. the ferry schedule I have memorized by now — not the destination 179. Baltic ice: not white but the colour of old glass pressed against old glass 180. the shopkeeper hears my accent and switches to English — I stay Swedish 181. four o&#x27;clock darkness in December — in Dhaka this hour still burns 182. the wake behind a ferry: proof the water was parted and returned 183. I trace birch bark grain with a finger — the pattern does not explain itself 184. in March the ice thins but does not go — hesitation as a kind of staying 185. a word in Swedish I understand but cannot yet say back correctly 186. the grey water holds nothing and holds everything grey water holds 187. December lamp glow in a window — someone else has already eaten 188. ferry wake in March: white ruts in grey — the water filling its own tracks 189. birch in winter light at 3:59pm — then the light is gone 190. I own a winter coat now, good wool, Swedish cut — still an outsider in 191. the Baltic at dusk smells like nothing I can name with any of my words 192. *varsågod* — a word for which I have no instinct only translation 193. ice at the dock&#x27;s edge the thickness of a secret held for one more day 194. birch bark in hand: it weighs less than I expected an island to weigh 195. four o&#x27;clock, the lamps, the curtains people don&#x27;t draw — small theatres of warmth Four Tongues, One Mouth 196. the word *tobu* sits in my mouth like a plum pit— no English for it 197. *Kul* in one language, *cool* in another—I am neither, I am both 198. my name in her mouth: *Pah-kah*, soft, Bangladeshi— my mother&#x27;s version 199. *Parker*, the barista writes—I do not correct him— the cup grows cold 200. *Pah-ka*, my landlord in Stockholm, vowels flattened— I nod, I am him 201. menu in three tongues: the fish is called three dead things— I point, I eat, fine 202. the word *sehnsucht* opens a room I have no key for— I stand at the door 203. I draft the letter: *আমি ভালো আছি*—cross it out— she knows I am not 204. *Mamoni*, I type, delete, type again, delete— what do mothers need 205. in the dream my boss hands me galleys in Bengali— I correct nothing 206. the Swedish word *lagom* has no Bengali cousin— enough is not enough 207. *Gemütlichkeit*— I explained it once in Dhaka— no one believed me 208. the menu says *smör*— my hand remembers *makhon*— butter forgives both 209. she said my name once in all four languages— I forgot my face 210. I write in English, dream in Bengali, curse in German—pray in none 211. abandoned letter, page three—the Swedish postbox fills up with April 212. I read the menu left to right, right to left, both— the waiter grows old 213. *Tygodnie*, she said— I thought it was Swedish—weeks passing in Polish 214. the Bengali script curves where the Latin goes straight— my hand chooses both 215. *Amar naam Parker*— four syllables that mean me— the river doesn&#x27;t care 216. in the dream I speak German to my father&#x27;s ghost— he answers in rain 217. the untranslatable: *আড্ডা*—to gather and talk with nowhere to be 218. I spell my surname four ways on four forms—all wrong, all exactly me 219. the letter begins *Kära*—Swedish for dear— I am not Swedish 220. *Liebling*, I once wrote— the editor marked it out— keep it personal 221. *jaan*, *Liebling*, *älskling*, *sweetheart*—I have said all four— meant the same each time 222. the dream shifts language mid-sentence—I keep talking— the listener nods 223. a Bengali joke lands in German—the silence is a kind of snow 224. three dictionaries, one question unanswered still: what is the word home 225. my tongue finds the click of a Swedish *k* and slips— the cashier waits What the Rain Remembers 226. the rain on glass here speaks Dhaka — I press one hand flat against the cold 227. one circled city faded where my thumb returned — Dhaka, worn to rust 228. the rain on the glass slows — I do not move my hand — we are both still here 229. cassette unspooling brown ribbon on the carpet — still, the music held 230. I circle the map not to find where I have been but where I slept well 231. cassette in a box: my father&#x27;s voice, a wedding, the wow and flutter 232. before sleep, the room holds all four cities at once — none of them loudly 233. the cassette clicks off — the room fills with what was there before I pressed play 234. the rain remembers how to fall on every roof I have ever had 235. the tape&#x27;s last song ends mid-note — I know this ending the way I know doors 236. I heard it this morning: a rain that knew Dhaka first then came here to rest 237. the tape warps slightly at the chorus — so does how I remember it 238. just before I sleep the four cities go quiet — not gone, just seated 239. a cassette, a map, a window with rain on it — the archive of rest 240. the quiet room fills slowly, the way good rooms do — with what was always here 241. evening on the Spree, evening on Riddarfjärden — same low copper light 242. the tape hisses once before the voice — that small gap I have lived inside 243. rain on the skylight: not Dhaka, not monsoon — just what rain does in May 244. four names for myself and tonight, in the quiet, none of them urgent 245. almost asleep now — Stockholm settles like a coat someone else broke in 246. pencil on the map: a line between two cities — not distance, just thread 247. before sleep the mind sets down what it carried all day — four cities, one breath 248. the rain I grew in recognizes something here — arrives less foreign 249. the river doesn&#x27;t compare itself to rivers — I am learning this 250. four cities circled in red ink — the pen ran dry somewhere over one</div>
