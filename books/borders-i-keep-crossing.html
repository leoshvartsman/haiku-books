        <div class='book-intro'>A haiku is a border crossing. You enter in one state and exit, seventeen syllables later, in another — changed by something you cannot quite name, carrying less than you arrived with. Alex Harris has spent a life crossing borders of the more literal kind: the cracked sidewalks of a Philadelphia childhood, the thin air of Colorado, the numbered queues of Viennese bureaucracy, the upside-down seasons of Melbourne. This collection gathers the residue of those crossings — not the grand narratives of displacement, but the small, exact moments in which the self is revealed to be more porous, more provisional, than it believed itself to be. A sparrow adjusting its grip on chain-link. A fluorescent tube that flickers once, then holds its breath. A passport spine worn soft as skin. Haiku has always known what the displaced person knows: that the present moment is the only ground you can stand on, and that ground is always moving. Harris works in this tradition without reverence for its conventions, finding in the form not a container for beauty but a scalpel for honesty — a way of cutting to the thing itself before the mind can dress it up in meaning. The poems here do not resolve the questions they raise. They do not tell you where home is or whether it can be recovered or invented or simply mourned. They tell you, instead, what it felt like to stand in a specific light, in a specific city, holding a name that may or may not have been yours, and to keep going anyway. The book moves roughly chronologically through a life in motion, but time here is less a line than a tide — Philadelphia resurfaces in Melbourne, Vienna echoes in Boulder, and the child who learned to say nothing by watching a sparrow is still present in the adult who presses a palm flat against unfamiliar stone. What survives the crossing, Harris seems to ask, and what must be surrendered at the gate? The answer this collection offers is not comforting, but it is true: you survive, changed past recognition, still reaching for the words.</div>
