        <div class='book-intro'>There is a kind of knowledge that lives below language — in the warmth a stone holds after dark, in the shape a wet coat keeps on its hook, in the smell of broth that travels under a closed door before any word of welcome is spoken. *What the Soil Remembers* is a book about that knowledge: the intelligence of surfaces, the memory stored in matter, the way the world continues to think long after we have stopped paying attention to it.

These 250 haiku move across cities and seasons, through Rome and monsoon mornings, through libraries and bare winter elms, through the slow theater of a river at dusk. What holds them together is not geography but a quality of attention — a willingness to press a palm to cobblestone and read what is written there, to find in the dark half of a lamplit room not absence but a kind of writing space. Marino is a poet of thresholds and residues: the orange a terracotta pot carries forward from its firing, the vein-dark joints between wet stones, the rook balanced in the bare arms of an elm. Again and again, these poems catch the world in the act of remembering something we ourselves have half-forgotten.

To read this collection slowly is to practice a particular discipline — the discipline of receiving rather than pursuing, of watching rather than grasping. The Tiber gives back only the watching; the blank field waits for the pen to find a pulse. These are poems that trust stillness, that believe the road can walk itself if we are quiet enough to let it. What the soil remembers, Marino suggests, it will tell us — but only if we are willing to kneel down and listen with our whole body.</div>
