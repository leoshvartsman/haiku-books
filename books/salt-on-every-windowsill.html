        <div class='book-intro'>There is a particular kind of attention that notices the freezer light in a corner store at two in the morning, that watches a cleaner push his cart through an empty terminal, that sees in a split fig not beauty or decay but simply wasps doing their one job. The haiku in this collection grew from that attention — unhurried, undeceived, and quietly committed to the world as it actually presents itself. *Salt on Every Windowsill* moves through airports and tram stops, tidal flats and kitchen drawers, the small ceremonies of travel and the equally small ceremonies of staying put. What holds these two hundred and fifty poems together is not a single geography but a single quality of looking: patient, a little wry, and unwilling to ask the moment to mean more than it does.

Many of these poems are concerned with thresholds — the pause before departure, the low tide that reveals and then erases, the passport photo that holds a younger face in permanent evidence. Wilson is drawn to the places where things are in transition, where cedar grain opens in rain, where mud takes an impression and then releases it by noon. But the collection resists the easy melancholy of impermanence. There is something steadier running beneath these poems — closer to acceptance than resignation, closer to curiosity than grief. A word written twice in a margin, once in blue and once in red. A meal that is enough because it is the meal you have.

Readers will find here a sensibility that has traveled widely and paid close attention, but that is equally at home with the hose that pulses once and settles, with the stone that is a different animal in the afternoon than it was in the morning. These are poems about what remains when we stop asking the world to perform for us — and about the surprising fullness of that remainder.</div>
