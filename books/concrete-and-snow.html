        <div class='book-intro'>These poems were written in transit — on trams and in waiting rooms, beside canals and in offices where the fluorescent light has been slightly wrong for years. They come from Oslo and Amsterdam, from cities in South Asia and Northern Europe, from anywhere that humans have built systems to move through and forms to fill out and pipes to carry heat through walls. What holds them together is not ...</div>

        <div class='sample-haiku'><h2>Sample Haiku</h2><div class="haiku"><p>wet wool on iron—</p><p>the radiator clicks once</p><p>and Oslo breathes out</p><p>tram bell in the dark,</p><p>sparks blue above the wire—</p><p>I count the stops home</p><p>birch bark peels back white</p><p>against the grey February—</p><p>one lamp in the school</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>rain on the canal:</p><p>each drop opens and closes</p><p>a mouth saying nothing</p><p>grey canal water—</p><p>the barge rope tightens, loosens,</p><p>tightens against stone</p><p>the radiator</p><p>knocks at three in the morning—</p><p>I do not wake her</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>the wallah pours chai</p><p>from height, a thin brown ribbon—</p><p>I watch it, not him</p><p>policy number</p><p>stamped in purple on pink sheet—</p><p>marigold outside</p><p>fan blade catches light</p><p>once per revolution—</p><p>I count without thought</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>claim form number six:</p><p>I stamp it blue and slide it</p><p>across his thin hands</p><p>December fog lifts</p><p>just enough to show the street</p><p>then swallows it whole</p><p>phone rings, no one there —</p><p>the office holds the echo</p><p>longer than I do</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>contrail over water,</p><p>already fraying at the edge</p><p>before I see it</p><p>the gate number changed—</p><p>I carry my single bag</p><p>to the new silence</p><p>Oslo, Manchester,</p><p>Delhi, Austin—the boarding pass</p><p>knows only one name</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>one grackle drops down,</p><p>finds nothing on the asphalt,</p><p>lifts without hurry</p><p>heat at ten o’clock—</p><p>the limestone wall already</p><p>holding yesterday</p><p>I drove the highway</p><p>slow enough to see them—blue</p><p>along the white edge</p></div>
