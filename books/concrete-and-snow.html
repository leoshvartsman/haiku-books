        <div class='book-intro'>These poems were written in transit — on trams and in waiting rooms, beside canals and in offices where the fluorescent light has been slightly wrong for years. They come from Oslo and Amsterdam, from cities in South Asia and Northern Europe, from anywhere that humans have built systems to move through and forms to fill out and pipes to carry heat through walls. What holds them together is not geography but attention: the specific, patient noticing that happens when you are somewhere between arrival and belonging, when the world is still strange enough to see.

*Concrete and Snow* is interested in the textures of ordinary urban life — the knock of a radiator, the arc of a tram spark, the thin ribbon of chai poured from a height — and in the way those textures accumulate into something that might be called a life. Many of these poems live in the gap between the bureaucratic and the beautiful: a policy number stamped in purple, a claim form slid across a table, and just outside the window, a marigold doing its indifferent, blazing work. The haiku form, with its insistence on the concrete and its resistance to explanation, seemed the right container for this kind of seeing. It asks the reader to do the connecting, to feel the weight of what is left unsaid between one image and the next.

If there is a mood that runs through the collection, it is something quieter than loneliness and warmer than solitude. These are poems about being a body in a city, about the small negotiations we make with cold and noise and other people&#x27;s paperwork, about the moments when the world briefly clarifies — fog lifting just enough to show the street — before it closes again. The hope is that readers will find their own cities here, their own three-in-the-morning radiators, their own counted stops home.</div>

<div class="haiku"><p>the wallah pours chai</p><p>from height, a thin brown ribbon—</p><p>I watch it, not him</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>claim form number six:</p><p>I stamp it blue and slide it</p><p>across his thin hands</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>contrail over water,</p><p>already fraying at the edge</p><p>before I see it</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>one grackle drops down,</p><p>finds nothing on the asphalt,</p><p>lifts without hurry</p></div>
