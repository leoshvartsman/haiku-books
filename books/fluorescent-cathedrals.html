        <div class='book-intro'># Introduction Welcome to *Seasons in Seventeen Syllables*, a collection of 250 haiku that celebrates both the timeless beauty of this ancient Japanese form and the innovative possibilities of our digital age. This anthology represents a unique collaboration between human creativity and artificial intelligence—a marriage of traditional wisdom and contemporary technology that opens new pathways for poetic expression. Haiku, with its deceptively simple structure of three lines containing approximately seventeen syllables (5-7-5 in traditional counting), has captivated readers worldwide for centuries. Born in Japan during the 17th century, haiku captures fleeting moments in nature and human experience with remarkable precision and depth. The best haiku create what Japanese poets call &quot;the haiku moment&quot;—that sudden flash of recognition when ordinary observation transforms into profound insight. Within these pages, you&#x27;ll discover both classical haiku that honor traditional elements—seasonal references (*kigo*), cutting words (*kireji*), and nature imagery—alongside contemporary pieces that stretch the form&#x27;s boundaries while maintaining its essential spirit. Some haiku present crystal-clear images of cherry blossoms or winter frost; others explore urban landscapes, modern relationships, and digital-age experiences through the haiku lens. This collection unfolds through the four seasons, beginning with spring&#x27;s emergence and cycling through summer&#x27;s abundance, autumn&#x27;s transformation, and winter&#x27;s contemplation. This seasonal organization reflects haiku&#x27;s deep connection to the natural world and invites you to experience the year&#x27;s rhythmic progression through concentrated moments of awareness. The haiku in this collection emerged through an AI-assisted creative process, where algorithms trained on thousands of classical and contemporary haiku generated new possibilities, which were then carefully curated and refined. This approach has yielded surprising juxtapositions, fresh perspectives on familiar themes, and occasionally, that perfect crystallization of experience that defines exceptional haiku. How might you engage with this collection? Some readers prefer to move sequentially through the seasons, allowing the natural progression to guide their journey. Others open randomly, letting chance determine their encounter with each poem. Consider reading aloud—haiku&#x27;s musicality often emerges through voice. Pause between poems; let each one settle before moving to the next. Notice how different haiku speak to you at different times, how your mood and circumstances color your reading. Most importantly, allow these brief poems to slow your pace, to heighten your attention to the world&#x27;s small miracles. In our age of constant information, haiku offers something increasingly precious: the gift of focused presence, the art of seeing deeply into a single moment. Step into the seasons. Let the journey begin. *Taylor Smith* ## Spring Spring arrives not with grand proclamations, but in quiet moments of renewal that catch us by surprise. This season of awakening reveals itself in the most ordinary places—rain-washed sidewalks where children&#x27;s art blooms anew, shop windows where flowers and dreams await their moment of celebration. The haiku in this section capture spring&#x27;s gentle insistence on hope and fresh beginnings. Here, the season unfolds through human rituals and natural cycles intertwined: the simple joy of chalk art reborn after a storm, the careful arrangement of peonies beside symbols of new love. These poems remind us that spring&#x27;s true magic lies not in the dramatic burst of cherry blossoms, but in the everyday resurrections happening all around us. In the Japanese tradition, spring haiku often celebrate *mono no aware*—the bittersweet awareness of life&#x27;s fleeting beauty. These verses honor that sensibility while finding it in distinctly contemporary moments, where childhood wonder and adult ceremony coexist, where renewal happens as naturally as rain giving way to sun.</div>
