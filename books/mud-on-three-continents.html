        <div class='book-intro'>Diya Shah has worked three kinds of earth — the black cotton soil of West Bengal, the frost-locked loam of the Swiss Plateau, and the sun-cracked clay of the Tuscan hills — and this book is the residue of that work. Written across a decade of farming, migrating, and learning to read new skies, these haiku do not argue for any single place as home. They argue instead for the body as the most honest record-keeper: the hands that remember how deep to push before the soil gives, the lungs that recognize a particular humidity before the mind has named it, the tongue that reaches for a word in one language and finds it already dressed in another. Shah writes from the position of someone who has chosen, repeatedly, to begin again — and who has discovered that beginning again is not erasure but accumulation, a kind of geological layering in which nothing is lost, only pressed deeper.</div>
