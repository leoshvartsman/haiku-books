        <div class='book-intro'>These poems were written across three coastlines and two decades, though the salt in the title belongs to no single shore. It belongs, instead, to a way of paying attention — to the moment before language arrives, when the body already knows something the mind is still reaching for. The haiku gathered here move between a Korean American childhood on the Pacific, years spent in the Mediterranean basin, and the long, unresolved middle of a life lived at the edges of more than one world. What held them together, as I arranged them, was not geography but a kind of recurring gesture: the hand pressed to glass, the word swallowed before it can be spoken, the ear tuned to what passes over a fence between people who are not quite enemies and not quite friends.

Haiku has always been a form that trusts the particular. A grandmother tapping pot lids. A lizard sharing the warmth of a stone. Pollen blooming under a thumb. I have tried to honor that trust, to resist the urge to explain what the image already holds. At the same time, these poems are quietly preoccupied with the limits of language — with the experience of carrying multiple tongues and finding, at certain necessary moments, that none of them opens. The Negev at dusk turns colors I have no name for in any language. That line is not a lament. Or not only a lament. It is also a kind of relief, the discovery that some things exceed the borders we have drawn around them.

Readers will find here a sensibility that is more patient than certain, more curious than resolved. The questions that sent me to deserts and fish markets and fogged dawn windows are still present in these pages, but they have been worn smooth by repetition, the way salt smooths stone. I offer this collection not as an account of arrival but as a record of the looking — which, I have come to believe, is the more honest and more lasting thing.</div>
