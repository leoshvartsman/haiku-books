        <div class='book-intro'>Home is not a place but a collection of moments—the weight of pine sap on summer fingers, the tremor of hands around unfamiliar teacups, the sound of one&#x27;s own voice learning to shape foreign syllables. *Four Winds, One Sky* traces the geography of belonging through seven landscapes of memory and discovery, each haiku a small anchor dropped in the flowing current of a life lived across continents. These poems map the immigrant heart&#x27;s journey from the crystalline nostalgia of childhood places through the uncertain thresholds of new worlds, toward that rare country where all our scattered selves finally converge. In seventeen syllables, each verse captures the sensory archaeology of displacement—how we carry the texture of first snow, the cadence of market voices, the particular slant of light that once defined everything we knew as home. This is a book about learning that we can love many places at once, that the sky above Camden and the sky above Dhaka hold the same moon, and that perhaps the truest home is found not in staying or leaving, but in the courage to remain open to wonder wherever we find ourselves.</div>
