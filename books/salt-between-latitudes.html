        <div class='book-intro'>There is a kind of knowledge the body accumulates before the mind catches up — the angle at which afternoon light means it is time to eat, the particular weight of air before a certain kind of rain, the way stone holds warmth like a kept secret. Salt Between Latitudes is a record of that knowledge in motion: what it costs to carry it across oceans, what it means to slowly, imperfectly, begin to accumulate another. These haiku trace a life lived between Jerusalem and Sydney, New Orleans and Melbourne, between the limestone dust of a childhood and the cool southern light of a chosen home — not as a tidy arc of arrival but as something more honest, more recursive, more strange.

Haiku has always been a form preoccupied with the present moment, with the precise sensory fact of now. But for the displaced body, now is rarely simple. It arrives trailing its own archaeology — a smell that belongs to somewhere else, a sound that opens the wrong door, a reflex calibrated to a weather system on the other side of the world. These poems hold that doubling without resolving it. They do not argue for assimilation or for preservation. They argue for attention — to limestone and jacaranda, to khamsin and harbour glare, to the silence that lives inside a throat that has learned to hold three languages at once.

The collection moves roughly chronologically through place, though place here is also always autobiography, and autobiography is always also climate. Readers may find that the geography shifts before the emotional weather does, or that grief appears in the wrong section, tenderness in an unexpected one. That slippage is intentional. The self does not update cleanly. What these poems offer instead is the residue — the salt left behind when the water moves on — and the slow, unfinished work of learning to read a new sky without forgetting the one you were born under.</div>
