        <div class='book-intro'>Salt does not stay where you leave it. It travels in the body, in the air, in the memory of every shoreline you have ever stood at and looked outward from. Salt Between Latitudes is a book about that kind of carrying — the slow accumulation of places that have pressed themselves into a single life, not as postcards or coordinates, but as textures, temperatures, the particular quality of light on water in four different cities across four different years. These haiku do not document a journey so much as they attempt to hold still, again and again, inside moments that refused to hold still themselves. Sam Brown has lived along coastlines and inside crossings — between languages, between belonging and its absence, between the person who left and the person who arrived somewhere new and had to begin the quiet work of becoming legible again. Haiku, with its demand for precision and its tolerance for incompleteness, turns out to be the right form for this kind of life. Each poem here is a threshold: seventeen syllables standing in the doorway between what was understood and what is still being translated. The book moves in seven sections, tracing an arc from the warm harbour of origin through disorientation, stillness, noise, and the particular labour of carrying other people&#x27;s words, before arriving — not at resolution, exactly, but at a different relationship with unresolvedness. Belonging, these poems suggest, is not a destination with a fixed address. It is something more like salt: invisible until the light catches it, always already on your skin.</div>
