        <div class='book-intro'>There is a moment this collection returns to again and again, though it never announces itself by name: the moment just before language arrives, when experience is still raw and unassigned, when the body knows something the ledger cannot hold. *Where the Light Arrives First* is a book about that threshold — about migration and belonging, about the names we inherit and the names we choose, about what survives translation and what, quietly, does not. These two hundred and fifty haiku move between New Zealand and Italy, between the southerly wind off the strait and the dried ink of a notary&#x27;s stamp, between a mother&#x27;s clothesline and a wine-dark ring on oak. They are not travel poems, exactly, nor are they poems of loss. They are something more patient than either: a sustained attention to the instants in which a life reveals its seams.

The collection is organized around images that recur and accumulate — the fig, the bell, the hyphen, the stain that cannot be closed. These are not symbols so much as companions, objects that agree to carry more than their own weight for a while. The tūī&#x27;s song, described here as something older than music, something throat-deep and private, might stand as an emblem for the whole project: the attempt to locate, in a form as compressed as a breath, what lies beneath the cultural and bureaucratic surfaces of a life lived across more than one world. What the split fig shows, as one poem puts it, is a chamber that no spreadsheet could have predicted. This book is full of such chambers.

Readers will find in these pages a sensibility that is precise without being cold, and searching without being sentimental. Sage Patel writes with the confidence of someone who has learned to sit with ambiguity — who understands that the hyphen chosen and the scar chosen can be the same thing, and that both are worth keeping. The white space in the ledger, the zero before the bell strikes, the moonlight caught in nets laid out for something else entirely: these are the coordinates of a cartography that no single language could complete alone. This is a book about what it means to arrive, knowing that arrival is never quite the word.</div>
