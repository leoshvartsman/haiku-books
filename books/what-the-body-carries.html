        <div class='book-intro'>Kaori Kato has lived in at least three languages, and this book is the record of what each one cost her. What the Body Carries moves from the terraced rice fields of rural Japan through the cold intellectual light of New England, into the heat of American faith and American power, and finally up into the thin air of Bogotá — where the city arrives before the lungs are ready for it. These haiku are not travel poems. They are something closer to testimony: small, precise acts of witness made by a woman who has crossed enough borders to understand that every crossing leaves a mark on the body before it reaches the mind.</div>

        <div class='sample-haiku'><h2>Sample Haiku</h2><div class="haiku"><p>autumn terraces—</p><p>each paddy holds a different</p><p>shade of going gold</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>workshop: they praise</p><p>the *restraint* in my poem—</p><p>I had meant to shout</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>drought-cracked soil outside</p><p>and inside, the carpet holds</p><p>the shape of old knees</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>the empty chair waits</p><p>the way a wound waits—</p><p>open, already knowing</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>Kato: I speak it</p><p>into the Bogotá air—</p><p>the altitude holds</p></div>
<div class="haiku"><p>Transmilenio stop:</p><p>a man reads the Bible standing,</p><p>swaying with the bus</p></div>
