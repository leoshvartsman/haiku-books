        <div class='book-intro'># Introduction Welcome to this collection of 250 haiku that bridge the timeless beauty of traditional Japanese poetry with the fresh perspectives of our digital age. Like cherry blossoms that bloom anew each spring while carrying the essence of countless seasons past, these verses honor haiku&#x27;s ancient roots while exploring contemporary themes and sensibilities. Haiku, in its classical form, captures a fleeting moment in nature through just seventeen syllables arranged in three lines. Born in 17th-century Japan, this deceptively simple poetry invites us to pause, observe, and find profound meaning in life&#x27;s smallest details—the splash of a frog in a pond, morning dew on grass, or snow settling on bare branches. Traditional haiku often includes a *kigo* (seasonal word) and a *kireji* (cutting word) that creates a pause for reflection, allowing two images or ideas to resonate together. This anthology embraces both classical elements and modern innovations. You&#x27;ll find haiku that strictly follow the 5-7-5 syllable pattern alongside others that prioritize natural speech rhythms and contemporary imagery. Some celebrate nature in Bashō&#x27;s tradition; others explore urban landscapes, technology, and modern human experiences through the haiku lens. The collection flows through four seasonal sections, beginning with spring&#x27;s renewal and cycling through summer&#x27;s abundance, autumn&#x27;s reflection, and winter&#x27;s quiet contemplation. This organization mirrors the Japanese concept of *saijiki*—seasonal almanacs that have guided haiku composition for centuries. Each season brings its own emotional palette and natural imagery, creating a year-long journey of observation and insight. There are many ways to experience these haiku. You might read straight through, letting the seasonal progression carry you forward like a year in miniature. Or open randomly and let individual poems speak to your current moment. Some readers prefer to linger with a single haiku, allowing its images to unfold slowly in the mind&#x27;s eye. Others enjoy reading several together, discovering how they echo and complement each other. Consider reading aloud—haiku&#x27;s musicality emerges through voice, and the brief pauses between poems create natural breathing spaces for reflection. Notice how each haiku attempts to capture not just a scene, but a feeling, a realization, or a moment of connection between inner and outer worlds. These verses emerged through an AI-assisted creative process, where human sensibility and artificial intelligence collaborated to explore what haiku might become in our interconnected age. Each poem was carefully curated to ensure it honors the spirit of haiku while speaking to contemporary readers. Whether you&#x27;re new to haiku or a longtime lover of the form, may these small poems offer you moments of stillness, wonder, and recognition in your daily journey. *—Jing Li* Spring arrives not with fanfare, but in quiet moments of recognition—the first tentative bird song threading through morning traffic, green shoots defying urban concrete, the gentle percussion of rain on newly opened umbrellas. This collection of five haiku captures spring&#x27;s persistent emergence in our modern world, where nature&#x27;s ancient rhythms continue their dance alongside human industry. These verses celebrate the season&#x27;s essential character: renewal meeting resistance, softness finding strength, life asserting itself in the most unlikely places. Here, construction hammers provide percussion for nesting sparrows, bamboo demonstrates the patience that moves mountains one crack at a time, and city commuters become unwitting participants in spring&#x27;s grand opening ceremony. In the Japanese tradition, spring haiku often focus on *mono no aware*—the bittersweet awareness of life&#x27;s fleeting beauty. These poems honor that heritage while finding wonder in contemporary landscapes, reminding us that spring&#x27;s transformative power persists whether witnessed in temple gardens or subway stations. Each verse invites us to pause and notice the season&#x27;s quiet victories unfolding around us.</div>
