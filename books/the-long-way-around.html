        <div class='book-intro'>Oregon Rain, Before Memory 1. streetcar track glinting through rain I may have invented— my heel remembers 2. I may have watched fog settle on the river—or watched my mother watch 3. glass fogged from inside— her breath, the boiling kettle, the fir-dark morning 4. mother stood there, yes, or I have placed her there since— the window stays wet 5. fog on the river— I was four, or five, or fog itself had no age 6. the river in fog does not know it is a river— I barely knew me 7. her hand on the glass left nothing—glass holds nothing— I hold it for her 8. streetcar track in rain: the groove exact and iron— memory, less so 9. fog on the Willamette— mother&#x27;s handprint still warm on cold November glass 10. kitchen window streaked— beyond it, firs I am not sure I actually saw 11. rain on streetcar tracks was a particular sound— not rain, not metal 12. kitchen window light: whatever she was watching watched her back through glass 13. her kitchen smelled of coffee, rain-damp wool, the fir pressing at the glass 14. I return to slugs on concrete steps in rain— they do not return 15. the Willamette fog tasted of cold metal and fish and almost-rain 16. kitchen warmth against the glass made the outside fog press closer, looking 17. November in Portland is a sound before a word— tires on wet asphalt 18. Willamette November: the fog so low the river lent it to the air 19. Douglas fir in rain does not drip—it measures time in drops we don&#x27;t count 20. the concrete step dark with rain—the slug&#x27;s silver trail already drying 21. I trust the slug more than the memory—both move slowly toward the edge 22. November river: the fog was not romantic— it was simply cold 23. kitchen window, 1933— the glass was wavy then— everything wavered 24. streetcar on wet rails made a sound like a question Portland never asked 25. fog erases the far bank first, then the near—then you forget there were banks 26. Douglas fir needles hold individual drops— not one falls the same 27. the streetcar is gone the tracks are gone the asphalt holds the shape of both 28. one slug, one wet step, one morning before language— this is what I own 29. her window, her breath, her coffee, the fir, the fog— I arrange these now 30. slug on the last step before the garden—pausing where the concrete ends 31. slugs cross the wet steps toward nothing I remember— the streetcar bell fades 32. Douglas fir drips onto nothing I can name— the sound remains true 33. one slug, very still on the gray step—childhood paused before it moved on 34. the Willamette runs behind everything I think I remember now 35. a Douglas fir holds yesterday&#x27;s rain until noon— releases it then The Education of an Argument 36. the casebook margin: my own handwriting, so sure— who was that young man 37. first year: I argued the professor into silence— second year: I stopped 38. broken spine casebook— I underline the dissent first, always the dissent 39. I argue both sides alone at my carrel until the janitor coughs 40. her hands on the desk, my first client, working hands— I forgot my notes 41. she asked me simply: can you help me keep my house— I shuffled my notes 42. she wore her good coat to meet me, her first lawyer— I was twenty-six 43. labor law, earmarked: I wrote &quot;wrong&quot; in the margin and then wrote &quot;maybe&quot; 44. her knuckles, cracked dry, flat on my clean desk blotter— I straightened my pen 45. broken spine, last case— the book will not close fully— neither will I, now 46. mimeograph ink blooms purple on my fingers— what does justice smell like 47. first year contracts text held together with rubber bands— the law is also rope 48. mimeograph stack warm from the machine, still wet— I read before dry 49. a burnt coffee ring halos the word &quot;negligence&quot;— I study the stain 50. reading room, midnight— three of us left, not speaking, each feeding our hunger 51. landmark case, dog-eared— I have read this page so often the print is going 52. cold coffee, 2 a.m., I cannot find the holding— I find the dissent 53. mimeograph carbon thin as a legal promise— both smear on contact 54. I argued so well I no longer knew which side had been mine at first 55. her first question was not what I had prepared for— I prepared wrong 56. mimeograph smell: the moment before you know if you passed or failed 57. tort law, November— the radiator bangs twice then gives up the heat 58. cigarette ash falls into Cardozo&#x27;s reasoning— I leave it there, gray 59. broken spine, page 40— the case where the man drowns and no one is at fault 60. his cigarette smoke drifts across the room toward mine— we do not agree 61. the reading room clock loses three minutes a night— no one reports it 62. in the reading room someone always weeping soft— we all look at books 63. margins full of ink, a whole semester&#x27;s hunger— the book sold for four 64. I never touched one— the gavel, that wooden word— I used paper, ink 65. the argument rests— outside, someone else&#x27;s war— inside, the next page Guadalajara Dockets 66. jacaranda blooms fall on the courthouse entrance— no one sweeps them up 67. rubber stamp descends— the ink still wet, the man gone before the door shut 68. six a.m. vendor wraps tamales in corn husks— the judge still sleeping 69. barranca thunder— the ceiling fan keeps turning through someone&#x27;s verdict 70. purple petals press into the tile&#x27;s grout lines— evidence of spring 71. the stamp&#x27;s red circle on the form that ends his lease— my signature, too 72. chiles laid in rows at the market before dawn— who counts what is owed 73. she speaks Mixtec and the court recorder writes a long dash, then stops 74. first lightning beyond the ravine—the brief flares lit before the rain knows 75. jacaranda tree outside the courtroom window— I cite precedent 76. I bring the paper already knowing its weight— the vendor counts change 77. dawn at the mercado: a man sells radishes, cut into roses, fast 78. the untranslated pause between question and shrug— I write it as &quot;no&quot; 79. barranca fills up with last night&#x27;s decisions and this morning&#x27;s red mud 80. petals on the sill of the room where we settled— he got almost nothing 81. the official seal pressed into bond paper— the tree outside blooms 82. vendor&#x27;s charcoal smoke at six drifts through the arcade— court opens at nine 83. she did not answer because the question assumed a world not her own 84. heat lightning, no rain— the barranca holds its breath the way a court does 85. the clerk&#x27;s rubber stamp has its own grammar: final, circular, and done 86. jacaranda root lifts the courthouse step an inch— the law adjusts 87. before the stalls fill a woman mops the market tile— jasmine in a pail 88. the defendant waits while counsel confers in two languages, not his 89. a petal&#x27;s wet bruise ground into the courthouse floor— foot traffic as law 90. I stamp the carbon, keep the yellow, hand the pink— the tree just flowers 91. orange seller at dawn stacks her work into a wall— no contract required 92. his hands on the dock rail, still, as the interpreter searches for the word 93. the barranca mouth swallows the evening whole— lights blink on uphill 94. where the jacaranda drops its load on the front steps no one holds the door 95. the notary&#x27;s stamp is shaped like a small country that can end a life 96. vendor and I share the same six a.m. corner— different ledgers 97. she asked me once: does the court know what it is to go without papers? 98. lightning cracks the ridge above the barranca—dogs bark at the echo 99. the petals don&#x27;t care whose name is on the title deed— they fall on us all 100. I bring my briefcase. the woman brings her daughter to translate her age. 101. the ink pad drying— the clerk presses down harder, the mark still too faint 102. before the plaza wakes, a boy sweeps jacaranda into a blue pile 103. he never spoke once across four hearings—the court recorded: compliant 104. a crushed petal on the magistrate&#x27;s left shoe— he never looked down 105. my stamp, his silence, the interpreter&#x27;s long breath— the form is complete 106. vendor weights her scale with one thumb, barely—enough to live on, she said 107. the case continues while the jacaranda blooms its second season 108. the rubber stamp waits in its tray like a small judge between assignments 109. she pointed at things instead of naming them—the court asked her to be clear 110. the barranca holds the city&#x27;s oldest rain—I hold my old motions What the Law Cannot Hold 111. blank signature line— the pen left a groove in it but no one&#x27;s name there 112. barbed wire catches light the same way it catches skin— both are meant to hold 113. the judge&#x27;s robe hangs on a nail beside the mop same hook, same darkness 114. flies on the window, the verdict still being read— they don&#x27;t wait for it 115. peso headline, 1994— my client folded it once and put it away 116. a contract unsigned is still a contract—ask the land on either side 117. the wire rusts slowly the boundary does not rust this is the difference 118. judge&#x27;s sleeve brushes the nail as he takes the robe— a small sound, nothing 119. courtroom flies return to the same warm pane of glass the law changes rooms 120. blank line at the bottom: someone&#x27;s life waiting there in the shape of space 121. the peso falls like something that was always going to fall—yes 122. a contract holds weight the way water holds a stone— briefly, then it drops 123. the robe on the nail makes the nail look important until morning light 124. flies on the sill, six— I counted them during the closing argument 125. this unsigned paper has better manners than most— it admits its gap 126. the boundary wire was surveyed by a man who slept well afterward 127. headline in the square: PESO SE DERRUMBA—birds walking over it 128. the judge lifts his robe from the nail—for a moment the nail is the judge 129. a fly&#x27;s path across the window rewrites nothing the law has written 130. blank signature line: who taught the document to leave that small door 131. my briefcase held it— the contract, the clause, the gap where justice wasn&#x27;t 132. the newspaper turns yellow at the same rate as the promises did 133. three flies, one window, one verdict: they share the light without agreement 134. the robe smells of must and cedar and something else— the years of saying so 135. peso, 1995— I had a good year that year I don&#x27;t say it twice 136. the contract&#x27;s blank line is not empty—it is full of what no one signed 137. wire along the ridge: the olive trees don&#x27;t lean from it they lean from the wind 138. the judge went to lunch the robe stayed on the nail, kept judging the empty room 139. courtroom in July— the flies knew where the heat was so did the lawyers 140. the headline curled up at both ends, as headlines do when the news is true 141. barbed wire in morning holds one bead of water—this is its only grace 142. I kept the contract in a file marked RESOLVED nothing in it was 143. the nail in the wall was there before the courthouse will outlast the law 144. flies don&#x27;t distinguish between the innocent and the window&#x27;s warm light 145. a line left unsigned is still an argument for something—ask the line Crossing to the Mediterranean 146. dawn gate C-seven — the janitor&#x27;s mop leaves trails no flight will follow 147. broken wheel catches on every expansion joint — I count the cracks home 148. luggage carousel still turning after mine stops: someone else&#x27;s life 149. first Hebrew I read: exit, exit, exit, exit — I take the last one 150. bougainvillea spills over limestone at dawn — Portland had nothing 151. the wall holds the flowers the flowers hold nothing at all — I stand in between 152. pink against white stone — I know this is beautiful and do not feel it 153. Arabic phrase book dog-eared at the wrong pages — I ask for water 154. she answers in French — my four languages fail me in the fifth country 155. Mediterranean: I expected it bluer — the fog is the same 156. first morning window, the sea neither welcomes nor refuses the light 157. I carried Portland here without knowing: the gray, the way mist sits low 158. suitcase in the hall, the broken wheel facing up — I leave it that way 159. ninety-seven years and still I unpack slowly, afraid of the drawer 160. what goes in first? the Spanish-English dictionary or the photograph 161. Ben Gurion at five — a child is crying somewhere past the second gate 162. the arrivals hall smells of strong coffee and fear — I recognize both 163. a gecko pauses on the bougainvillea stem — new fauna, same nerve 164. the sea from my roof: I thought it would answer something — it only reflects 165. first address written in a hand I barely trust: my own, in Hebrew 166. the street name sounds like a prayer I was never taught — I walk it anyway 167. neighbor&#x27;s radio: news in Arabic at noon — I catch every third word 168. the vendor&#x27;s Arabic: I answer in Spanish first — we both start over 169. the courthouse in Guadalajara had shade — this square offers only light 170. my law books, boxed, shipped to a storage unit in a city I left 171. I chose the final place the way a lawyer chooses the weakest argument 172. courageous, they say — to move at ninety-seven — I call it running out 173. the sea does not care what I call it in any of my four languages 174. morning: I do not know which direction is east — the light corrects me 175. political beauty: flowers chosen by committee — still, the color holds Tel Aviv, Ordinary Hours 176. the cat shifts its weight under the ficus—morning moves around it 177. pigeon on the rail stares at my coffee cup we are both waiting 178. shuk HaCarmel: someone&#x27;s elbow in my ribs— still, the smell of mint 179. news in Hebrew first then Arabic, then English— the same dead, three times 180. hora circle widens to include the folding chairs— I stay in my seat 181. one pigeon missing from the usual four— the railing just railing 182. friday fish stalls, loud the ice beneath the sea bass older than the week 183. I turn the broadcast off then on—the anchor&#x27;s mouth moves before the words 184. ficus roots lifting the sidewalk on Rothschild— slow municipal fact 185. the cat does not watch the wedding—only I watch the cat watching nothing 186. my neighbor dances the hora in borrowed shoes— her ankles, honest 187. shuk on friday morning: the pomegranate split open like a verdict 188. three pigeons, then four then three again—I have learned not to name this loss 189. Arabic radio through the kitchen wall at six— my coffee, cooling 190. the ficus in shade makes shade inside its own shade— the cat knows this well 191. I read the headline in English, then in Hebrew— the lie holds in both 192. friday afternoon the shuk goes quiet so fast— a verdict, not peace 193. pigeon pecks the rail finds nothing, pecks again— I recognize this 194. hora: the circle has no beginning I see— I came in too late 195. under the ficus the cat&#x27;s ribs move, that is all— enough for morning 196. shuk HaCarmel: price of tomatoes, price of dill— no price for the hour 197. wedding music stops the hora stops—then resumes as if it forgot 198. I catch one word in the Arabic broadcast: water— the rest I could guess 199. ficus on Rothschild, older than the state—its roots argue with the curb 200. the cat sleeps through noon through siren test, through the trucks— its faith, embarrassing 201. friday crowd thickens near the olive stall—I stand at the outer ring 202. four pigeons, one rail— the math of a balcony at ninety-seven 203. news at six, at nine, at midnight—the same footage, different announcer 204. the hora pulls left then right—democracy of tired feet 205. shuk: a child holds up a bunch of radishes, proud— the vendor ignores her 206. pigeon on the rail lifts one foot, then the other— this is governance 207. under the ficus a plastic bag, a sandal— the cat moves closer 208. the anchor says peace in Hebrew—in Arabic the same word, different weight 209. friday morning, late— the shuk vendors fold the signs before I decide 210. my neighbor&#x27;s wedding: the hora goes on longer than the speeches did 211. the ficus casts shade the cat casts nothing—I cast a short shadow, west 212. three languages on one broadcast—each one losing something in itself 213. hora: someone&#x27;s hand pulls mine—I stand, I follow— the circle forgives 214. pigeon on the rail looks at Tel Aviv below— I do the same thing 215. friday morning shuk— I buy what I do not need to stay in the noise Borders Are a Kind of Poem 216. first light, the soldier lifts the gate — a bird crosses without papers 217. olive tree, halved — each half still making olives for separate mouths 218. the olive tree&#x27;s roots pass under the wall — the wall does not know this yet 219. split tree, each half throwing its own shadow — the wall runs exactly between 220. the rifle strap coils on the empty bus seat like something that was said 221. she drew the house first, then the flag — then crossed it out — left the chimney smoke 222. first light on the gate&#x27;s iron bar — the orange rust older than the law 223. the olive tree split not by lightning but by men reading different maps 224. the wall&#x27;s concrete still wet in memory — now birds nest in its seam 225. two soldiers share one cigarette at the crossing — smoke doesn&#x27;t divide 226. the gate opens slow — a man carries oranges — they are inspected 227. the young guard asks twice for my name — the second time he already knows 228. the olive tree fruits on the west side — the east side flowers without fruit 229. I drafted contracts for thirty years — I know how a blank line threatens 230. the ceasefire holds like a word held in the mouth — not swallowed, not said 231. the split tree does not mourn its other half — the half that can see it does 232. ceasefire draft, unsigned — a moth circles the lamp twice then finds the dark 233. checkpoint at four a.m. — the guard&#x27;s breath visible, mine held inside me 234. the ceasefire text ends mid-sentence — a cursor blinking in the dark 235. between the two flags a strip of unmowed grass grows tall as a child&#x27;s waist 236. the document unsigned — we shook hands anyway, both knowing what that meant 237. at the checkpoint, dawn — a rooster in the village the guards cannot hear 238. his rifle leans on the bus window — outside, an almond tree in bloom 239. I have crossed this kind of border before — each time something stays behind 240. unfinished sentence: the parties agree to cease — the page ends there 241. what the ceasefire cannot say: the bread that was baked and not eaten 242. rifle strap on the seat — the soldier sleeps — the city passes in the glass 243. a border is drawn in ink — the river ignores — the ink does not run 244. checkpoint at sunrise — a woman&#x27;s scarf, the color of the light above 245. a ceasefire is a sentence with a subject and no predicate 246. the bus seat holds the shape of the rifle strap all day — indentation, dumb 247. first light at the gate — the guard&#x27;s shadow stretches back toward where he came from 248. the rifle strap warm on the empty seat — whose son rides the next checkpoint 249. soldier, nineteen, scrolls his phone at the checkpoint — war waiting beside him 250. the ceasefire holds through Tuesday — by Wednesday the sentence resumes</div>
